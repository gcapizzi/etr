      "description": "E Pellicci, which opened while Queen Victoria was still on the throne, is the prettiest, oldest caff in London. Stepping into the place feels like opening the door of an elaborate, century-old Art Deco grandfather clock, only to find a thriving community restaurant inside. It’s perfect, really – and one of the most historic places to eat in the city. \n\nWhile the Grade II-listed dining room caters to a close-knit family of East End regulars during the week, it bursts into a joyful, party-like atmosphere every Saturday morning. On a typical Saturday, Nevio Jr. is liable to leap up onto the counter any moment, to announce a birthday by banging on a metal jug, before his sister Anna leads the packed room in song. The ritual always ends with cousin Tony playing “Je t’aime moi non plus” by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg on the speakers, which is a weird song to choose, but strangely apt. \n\nThe restaurant’s extraordinary longevity comes down to two things: the Pelliccis, who bring the place to life with their unique brand of sweary Cockney-Italian hospitality, and their delicious, carb-loaded food, which appears to be what happens when those two cultures collide. Smart people go for the chicken pie with chips, gravy and broccoli cheese, but everything on the menu is easy to fall in love with, from the spag bol to the American-sized fried breakfast, which may be the biggest full English in London.",

Oliveira comes from a Brazilian-Italian background; and this is reflected in dishes such as hand-made pastas and risottos, alongside the use of Amazonian fruit and veg. There are plenty of dishes with breadfruit and jackfruit sourced from Tooting market; and speciality items such as dende oil, phytoplankton, and vegan faux gras. Some of the over-ambitious dishes don’t quite come off, but “‘nduja sausage” made from jackfruit seeds and flesh, cassava, and smoked paprika impresses with its subtle spiciness, and a trio of Amazonian fruit sorbets made from açai, cupuaçu and pitaya taste like frozen nail polish — in the nicest possible way.",

Later Kappacasein morphed into an always-busy trolley in the Market, and more recently a permanent stall at the top of Stoney Street. In 2005, the esteemed American food writer Ruth Riechl described Bill’s sandwich as ‘the Platonic ideal of toasted cheese’; and it remains towards the top of London’s on the go pantheon.

At Maria’s, visitors can enjoy all manner of things inside a pillowy bap, including lamb, liver, and wild game sausage.

The original caff was where the eponymous Maria Moruzzi grew up and later worked, alongside her parents who opened the place, before they had to give it up. When they opened their stall in the market, this time with Maria in charge, she naturally put her name on it.

While the Palmers Green restaurant scene has traditionally focused on the taverna, Alex Eleni was the first to identify the need for something that was quick and casual but not a bakery. His solution is absurdly simple: a sandwich shop straight from Nicosia, serving foot long subs of halloumi, lountza and loukanika on crusty sesame bread out of a panini press, with an optional (obligatory) serving of trahana, a cracked wheat soup with halloumi. So far, so Cyprus. But the real draw is Eleni himself, a Southgate boy with something of the wheeler dealer about him who is known by literally everyone in the area. Of course this would not be north London without a bit of unnecessary machismo: Alex’s has a sandwich eating competition to win £500, sponsored by a local estate agent and attempted by local geezers (the last person spotted doing this was the dad in Stavros Flatley. He gave up.) The sandwich bar format has since been replicated across north of North Circular north London, but there’s still only one Alex.",

The sandwiches here are a showcase for sweet and fluffy pandesal, which can either be filled with a lightly spiced, rich egg mayo or gooey corned beef hash encased in a croquette, both imaginatively showcasing what is too often considered a poor ingredient in a package that gives the renowned Tata Eatery sando a run for its money.",

From Sicily, trebbiano from Guccione — perfectly in keeping with the dusty corners and drafty edges of this space.

All this is evidence, along the with cult favourite cheese spring rolls on the bar menu and one of London’s most interesting wine lists, that the Drapers does things slightly differently.

There’s the simple but special lobster with butter, pepper and garlic, and coconutty prawn masala, and make sure not to scrimp on sides like egg paratha and fried okra. Perhaps one of London’s most underrated restaurants.",

It specialises in Southwest coastal cuisine that includes the states of Karnataka and Kerala, and is owned by the neighbouring St James’ Court, part of the Taj group of hotels. It’s a beautifully designed space, with a bar area leading to a dining room decorated with ornate ‘jaali’ screens and splashes of bold, bright watercolours; and a division bell for MPs from nearby Houses Of Parliament. Seafood is a speciality here, and two of the signature dishes include a gentle moilee of halibut and prawns, and subtly spiced baked black cod. Pulao of green jackfruit pieces that taste like artichokes, made substantial with lentil nuggets, is rich with ghee and sunny with saffron. Staff are lovely; and there are freebies thrown in such as papads with pickles, a palate cleanser shot of rasam, and cardamom-flavoured chocolate — so the strict no-tipping policy can feel awkward for diners who want to reward such great-value food and service.",

The Nook opened in July 2020, and the kitchen is headed up by Ankara-born Lale Oztek-Pook, who moved to London when she was 25. After training at Cordon Bleu and working in Italian restaurants, at The Nook she began cooking the Turkish food of her heritage, with some twists. She told *Eater*, “In London, in a wine bar, hummus is going to be popular. I wanted to put my spin on it and make it fun.” The hummus itself is glossy, with the faintest hint of grain, a heavy dose of garlic, a lighter touch of lemon, and a high rate of chickpea in the chickpea-to-tahini ratio. The spin Oztek-Pook speaks of is a pickled naga chilli oil, which adds smoky, fiery, slightly sweet complexity to the dish. It is then garnished with crispy chickpeas, which give crunch and texture. There is no pita or pide ekmek to dip with, but Bread by Bike’s sourdough is sliced thick enough to be up to the task. Lale had not eaten Indian food before moving to London: This hybrid dish truly is a London hummus.",

Still, at a restaurant promising to reinterpret Tehran’s hole-in-the-wall eateries, one might not expect to see hummus on the mazeh section. Berenjak’s hummus is certainly a reinterpretation, with its texture closer to parfait than to a classic hummus, and as the sesame-laced taftoon bread baked in a clay tanoor just minutes before arrives to the table, there’s a definite sense of expectation. The mix combines black chickpeas with Aleppo pepper and green raisins, in addition to tahini and lemon juice. It is adorned with grated and chopped walnuts, and flavour-wise, the dip is layered with quintessentially Iranian fragrant and slightly sweet tones. As the scent of saffron wafts by, and Farsi-language music blasts from the speakers, the frankly delicious dish gets headier and headier.",

Her halloumi with black seed honey has been widely celebrated in the media, but the hummus dish is equally impeccable. After much experimentation over the ideal chickpea-to-tahini ratio, the silkiest form has been masterly achieved. It is garnished with pine nuts, chickpeas, and less conventionally, nutty brown butter; an ingenious touch that is one of co-founder Marc Summers’s contributions to the menu. Laffa, an Iraqi flatbread here produced by Ararat, the lauded baker on Dalston’s Ridley Road Market, provides a wonderfully contrasting dipping device. It is soft and pillowy, but with slightly charred crispiness on pockets of the surface.",

But there’s much more to recommend this modern British restaurant armed with heavy-set tables in a Grade II-listed building than its beer matrix. It’s just as winning to get a pint of bitter and a classic Scotch egg as it is a hazy IPA and a bowl of nuts spiced with aleppo pepper, black sesame seeds, and agave syrup. The steaks, burgers, and chips are all top quality, the latter rustling restlessly from the fryer, and the generous Moroccan flatbreads are genuinely excellent. Great for a hearty lunch or a slap-up dinner.",

From an overlook of the River Cam, the garden and terrace lend a winning homeliness to the proceedings, which are steered by founding chef patron Daniel Clifford and head chef Mark Abbott.

Oysters are present when appropriate, and are beautifully shucked and presented; a quasi-secretive specials board will often conceal jewels in the British crown like langoustines and lobster. Come Christmas, there is always roast goose — a wonderfully Dickensian flourish for a restaurant ideally suited to celebrating high days and holidays alike.",

A liver adobo is at the top of London’s pantheon: soft, creamy, honking with garlic, paired with an off menu garlic rice that can be felt on the breath the next morning. Sisig radiates like a sun, pig finely chopped, less heavy on the offal than other versions but with a strong crispy caramelisation of the heat of the pan. Pancit palabok is a cipher of a rich carbonara, with pancit for spaghetti, dried fish providing parmesan’s umami, pork rind for guanciale, egg the texture of tofu and then a whole load of prawns and squid.

It also has a wide array of pancit, Filipino noodle dishes, but it’s the palabok, in which they are stir-fried with prawns, squid and smoked mackerel, shows off a distinct salty flavour unique to the Philippines.",

A liver adobo is at the top of London’s pantheon: soft, creamy, honking with garlic, paired with an off menu garlic rice that can be felt on the breath the next morning. Sisig radiates like a sun, pig finely chopped, less heavy on the offal than other versions but with a strong crispy caramelisation of the heat of the pan. Pancit palabok is a cipher of a rich carbonara, with pancit for spaghetti, dried fish providing parmesan’s umami, pork rind for guanciale, egg the texture of tofu and then a whole load of prawns and squid. Finish with taho, layered silken tofu in a pool of lukewarm syrup, hitting all the comfort points of a morning bowl of porridge sweetened with honey.",

The challah bread perfectly doughy and flavorsome from the addition of wholegrain; the hummus profoundly blessed with the essence of chickpea flavour. But perhaps the star of the show was so-called “herb-powered falafel.” Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more herbaceous falafel, and the texture too, could simply not be improved. The layered dipping sauce of tahini with amba lurking underneath was a playful touch. Keep an eye out for its next move.",

Melted white cheese is then smeared, before filling the bun with onions and sausage. Next, it’s topped with ketchup, mayonnaise, salsa rosa — ketchup and mayonnaise — crushed crisps and radioactively orange pineapple sauce. The result is a hot dog with a flavour profile that threatens to topple under its own weight: as the pineapple becomes too sweet, along comes a wave of salty cheese to reset the taste buds.

Once baked and cooled, the sponge is cut in half and filled with generous amounts of vanilla buttercream and seasonal homemade jam — right now, eye-popping pink rhubarb, but apricot, strawberry, blackberry and nectarine and peach jams have featured when in season. The result is a faultless classic that sits proudly on the counter like an ambassador for baking with the best British produce.",

These crispy-oil slicked pastry behemoths, layered or spiralled, bulging with fillings such as locally sourced lamb merguez sausage, feta, apricot and confit spring onion, were an instant hit, and by March 2021, Mystic Börek had moved into a professional kitchen, with demand continuing to exceed capacity. Amidst a menu of aggressively savoury, salty, punchy flavours, there is one sweet pie: a tres leches börek that combined Dinkovski’s favourite dessert, this time made by her mother, with her love of börek. This ludicrously rich creation consists of a light sponge soaked in three milks (condensed milk, evaporated milk and double cream) rolled up in filo pastry and baked. Next, the entire börek is drenched in double cream and caramel and left to soak overnight, before being finished with a dark, slightly smoky salted caramel and a flurry of rose petals. Served straight from the fridge, ice cold, crisp pastry shards floating on a sea of cream and caramel make for a joyous layering of textures and temperatures, this really is as decadent as it gets.",

Customers should be prepared to get silly with delight when presented with dessert: marvel at a quince Knickerbocker glory that will knock sunshine into the bleakest day; sing oranges and lemons to a St Clements cream (a Simon Hopkinson citrus posset from the 1990s); or plunge gleefully into the glistening warmth of a treacle tart with Jersey cream.",

The bold egg mayonnaise, a mainstay of the snack menu, epitomises the restaurant’s wholesome glamour. A perfectly boiled egg lathered in rich blonde mayonnaise, and two silver anchovies intimately criss-crossed on top, like a forgotten pair of long drop earrings after a party.

      "description": "A protégé of iconic British chefs like Jeremy Lee, Ruth Rogers and Margot Henderson, and now at the helm of her own restaurant, Cafe Deco’s Anna Tobias is a self-styled champion of “beige food”: a shorthand to describe food that doesn’t need to draw attention to itself or visually “wow” in order to prove its calibre. However the puddings at Cafe Deco tell a different story, with excessive, eccentric, visually arresting retro desserts rebelling against the pared-back, casual sophistication of the savouries. “Puddings, more than anything, pull on people’s nostalgic heart strings”, Tobias explains, and her Black Forest gateau is a faithful rendition of a German classic, boasting a traditional, “over-the-top joyful verging on naff appearance”. The cake consists of three towering layers of chocolate sponge soaked in Kirsch and cherry liquor, filled with squashy layers of fresh cream and boozy cherries. The entire cake is then coated with more cream and an explosion of chocolate shavings, and topped with 12 perfect swirls of squirty cream, each crowned with a whole cherry, ensuring every slice looks like something straight out of a 1950s German baking book. With weekly changing menus released each Monday, diners need to act fast when it hits the offering. But in Tobias’s capable hands, they can be confident that whatever is on the menu will impress.",

The first food hall in London was in Oriental City, on the city’s outskirts, where Chinese, Malaysian and Japanese stalls all competed in harmony until it was shut down in 2008. It took another 10 years for the concept to come back, this time in the centre of London, in places that command the highest real estate prices in the city. Now it’s come to the inner city: first an abortive attempt at Nag’s Head last year, then Market Place, the first in what promises/threatens to be a London wide chain. Although partially completed before the pandemic, it is now fully operational with around ten new stalls and a bar. Highlights include Bang Bang Kitchen, a Ghanaian stall expert at protein cooking, with fatty turkey suya, and, best of all, chicken ball suya, a cross between West African barbecue and an Ikea meatball. At Full Bowl Sya Wang Kee, a brother and sister team have brought Hong Kong’s obsession with Hawaiian food to Peckham, with rice bowls, and more vertiginously, rice sandwiches, wrapped in nori and encasing fillings like “spam and egg” or “pork chop, cheese and mystery mustard,” a kind of demented kimbap. At Tianjin Dumplings, the dumplings themselves are fairly skippable, but an egg and chive pie makes a formidable crispy snack, and the owner puts Ruffles crisps in his jianbing, displaying a dedication to hedonism. It’s too soon to say if Market Place is a good thing for the area or not, but once it finds its toes it may offer a more accurate reflection of Peckham than curated spaces usually allow.",

Hordes of immaculately dressed shoppers and students gather for hot pots, whole fish in chilli oil, numbing Chongqing noodles, cumin-studded grilled skewers, and Chinese hamburgers while competing with the staff for the coolest look. This extremely trendy restaurant is a scene all of its own, but not unwelcoming; it’s perfect for a group booking.",

But waiting is part of the experience at this outstanding Pakistani restaurant specialising in Pashtun cuisine. Everything here is done on a huge scale: the karahis that start their life as a bobbing mass of lamb and whole tomatoes, steamed until they lose their skin and dissolve into the sauce; chapli kebabs like funeral boats in a sea of animal fat, so they arrive moist with a solid centimetre of blackened crust. Only the rooms are small and private, full of people reclining over a communal mat eating sharp charsi karahi or platters of grilled meat. The essential dish is gola karahi, loose and aggressively spiced minced meat kebabs that add a note of char to complete a flawlessly layered sauce shiny with lamb fat. One of London’s best dishes at one of London’s best restaurants.",

The cuisine, which is heavily influenced by Afghan and Central Asian culinary traditions, is characterised by the use of limited ingredients, delicate spicing, and a focus on fatty meats that are important fuel in the region’s harsh winters. Flattened beef chapli kababs the size of frisbees are speckled with coriander seeds, red chilli flakes, and tomatoes — fried on high heat to ensure a charred and crispy exterior while maintaining a juicy interior. The cooked-to-order karahis with tender pieces of lamb or chicken simmered in tomatoes, salt, pepper, and ginger are legendary as is the kabuli pulao with lamb shank falling off the bone buried under a dome of rice. Reserve the upstairs communal seating section and take a group of four to six friends to order most of the menu. Enjoy the spread with oblong naans that tower over. (No alcohol.)",

Although it’s no longer quite the destination restaurant it once was, what Silk Road does retain is its energy ─ even if its audience often resembles some kind of mash-up between something called “Left Twitter” and a Theatre and Performance seminar at Goldsmiths. “Here’s what to order from Silk Road” has become a literal meme, but here it is anyway: the best things are the most straightforward, kebabs (lamb shish, kidneys, fish), homestyle cabbage in an umami rich sauce which is at least 80% scalding oil, and the tomato, egg, and pepper noodles, with its cumulonimbus egg whites coddling noodles and barely cooked tomato chunks.

This lasted roughly up until the pandemic when it changed again. Now it’s is more or less back to exclusively Sichuanese food but the menu is massively reduced, the food is quieter and more homely, with simple but effective quick-fry dishes like lamb and cumin; satisfyingly chewy chaoshou dumplings in red oil; and northern-style braises, like an excellent rendition of di san xian’s aubergine, green pepper and potatoes crawling with star anise.

As with any extremely busy London place, Beigel Bake’s staff don’t suffer fools gladly. But if customers ask quickly and politely, they are more than happy to recommend something to try, such as the crumbly cheesecake, which like everything else here is made on-site.

As all the roti skins and fillings are made by Una, they have a softer, less oily and industrial texture than other places. It also means that the select choice of fillings — stewed and curried chicken or goat — have more depth of flavour and seasoning to them. The fry bakes are also a joy, to be snapped up whenever they are spotted in the side warmer.

Conversations spark between strangers sharing tables who alternate between Urdu and Punjabi to express their views, variously, on the state of economic affairs in the motherland or bemoan the Pakistan cricket team’s dismal recent performance. Essentially a mithai shop serving a variety of sweetmeats, pastries, and packaged snacks; on Sundays, only Al Kareem serves two varieties of breakfast platters that have people queuing outside, even in inclement weather: halwa puri and chana pathoora. Opt for the halwa puri platter and witness, live, the action of puri preparation on a meticulously arranged assembly line. Balls of kneaded flour are rolled out, slapped between the hands to be shaped into discs and then spun into in a bubbling cauldron of oil for a few seconds before they emerge expanded balloon-like. Puris are served alongside stewed potatoes with a liberal sprinkling of nigella seeds, masala chickpeas, pickled onions, and moist semolina halwa with a marigold hue. Finish off with a salty pink Kashmiri chai topped with crushed pistachios. (No alcohol.)",

      "description": "The name of this North London establishment may suggest Arabian Nights themed revelry but Aladin Kababish is truly Pakistani at heart. Aladin excels in the unhurried preparation of haleem, a dish that is renowned for its labour intensive preparation involving hours of slow cooking and pounding lentils, wheat, barley and lamb in a circular motion till they form glutinous strands. Another star attraction is nihaari, a lamb shank curry almost velvety in texture which is slowly cooked overnight for the connective tissue to melt down completely. Garnished with coriander, thin shards of ginger, and green chillies, it used to be prescribed as a cure for common colds in the 19th century due its throat and nasal passages clearing properties. The dish’s name is derived from the Arabic word *nahaar*, or daytime, which alludes to the fact that it’s traditionally eaten for breakfast. Often served with spoonfuls of brain and marrow (for extra fortification), nihaari is notorious for running out by noon in dedicated nihaari houses in Pakistan but at Aladin Kababish it can be enjoyed all day long.

Biff takes the fruit, slow cooks it in sweet BBQ sauce, then slings it onto burger buns or shapes into chicken wings and fries them. So called: “Filthy AF vegan junk food.” *Biff’s Jack Shack is roving. Find out where it is* [*here*](https://biffsjackshack.com/where-the-junk%3F)*.*",

The cuttlefish and ham croquette remains a standout dish; langoustine with bloody marie rose is as good as minimal shellfish service gets; the rum baba has nothing to do with seafood but is an essential order nonetheless.",

However the kernel of Ikoyi was born, the idea that a restaurant could use techniques and ingredients from West Africa, decontextualise them and repurpose them in unexpected ways. The use of a complex spice powder applied at the end of the dish for seasoning and aromatics is not unique to Nigerian food; indeed there are obvious Chinese, as well as French avant-garde, connections detectable in Ikoyi’s most iconoclastic dish — the plantain with raspberry salt. More explicitly, Chan pushes the idea of suya in a new direction — the mushroom suya infused with pine must first be dipped in an emulsion and then the yaji, while a beautiful thick cut of grass-fed beef inauthentically medium rare comes not coated with yaji but on the side, so the customer applies it to taste. Is this West African food? No, but it definitely is top grade suya.",

They glow luminous shades of orange and yellow and taste uncannily of their vegetable: testimony to the talent and dedication of the chefs that spend weeks concentrating the best seasonal produce into mind-bending gelato flavours that sell out in a flash. The technicolour palette of seasonal specials also includes vibrant purple hues of roasted plum and uva fragola, though don’t overlook the paler, more subtle flavours such as ricotta, pear, and toasted wheat.

Turkish-Cypriot. Despite being voted #1 on Tripadvisor in the days when this meant slightly more than nothing, the fish and chips themselves are great, if sometimes needing more heavy handed seasoning. Oddly, the banana fritters impress the most. Here they arrive like yogurtlu adana in their ovular tray, logs of carefully battered banana, not a trace of grease in sight, cheap whipped cream as yoghurt, cinnamon standing in for chilli flakes and a drizzling of caramel. The crunch of the well-seasoned batter yields to perfectly molten banana, the richness of the caramel is cut through by the sandy warmth of the cinnamon. There is a sprig of mint to signal it was made by someone who cares. In short: a minor miracle.",

Also delicious is the murgh malai kebab, tender cubes of gently blistered chicken, singing with citrus flavour, which fulfil the menu’s bold promise that they will, quote: “melt in ur mouth.”",

Raw meat is marinated with their signature ground masala, including shahi jeera, cinnamon, fried onions, and cardamom. The special chicken biryani for two is an absolute whopper and comes decked with juicy chicken tikka pieces and boiled egg, while the regular dum biryani for one is served with rice and meat on the bone. It also serves fish, egg, vegetable, and prawn biryani, and, if too much spice is not someone’s game, the cooks will gladly alter the levels.",

So be prepared to wait. There are many classics from the region, such as nizami gosht, kuska bagara, and haleem — but the one thing everyone comes here for is the generously portioned, excellent-value biryani. It more than lives up to expectations: cooked dum style, but served without the theatrics of a pastry lid, the golden grains of rice are generously studded with beautifully spiced lamb, chicken, seafood, whole boiled eggs or vegetables, then topped with a tangle of crisp caramelised onions. This is also one of the few places to find khubani ka meetha, a classic pudding of stewed dried apricots and apricot kernels steeped in cream; and ‘Irani chai’, a strong, slow-brewed Persian tea made with reduced milk solids that’s ubiquitous in Hyderabad, but not widely available in London.",

London’s Flavortown is located in Loughborough Junction, in true south London style between a fake Morley’s simply called MMM and a vape shop. Casa Mofongo makes this sandcastle of smashed unripe plantain and chicharron in the Dominican mode: dry, with salty cheese melted on top and fatty pork on the side, the plantain itself absolutely honking of enough garlic to appease those who double the garlic in any recipe. Outside of the mofongo there are plenty of rarely seen Dominican stews, as well as a pica pollo up there with La Barra’s: golden fried chicken, chicharron, and bofes (dried lungs).",

An excellent rendition of the Colombian national dish ‘bandeja paisa’ comes as an enormous platter of meat and protein, including standout crispy chicharron and kidney bean stew. The gentrification continues apace, but El Rancho still outflanks units selling food at twice the price.",

What it actually is is something much more radical than that: a deli which is entirely subservient to the needs of the close-knit, mixed-economy community of Bonnington Square. There’s a bohemian aspect to Charlie Boxer’s deli, started 10 years ago with friend Luigi Di Lieto (of the family who run the equally excellent Di Lieto) that could veer too much towards luvviness if it wasn’t for the generosity, a place where the staff seem to know every customer’s name and vice versa, where the food has no genre except “stuff you want to eat”, and where there’s never too little parmesan dusted over a plate of pasta. Breakfasts are full Englishes with Italian accents — a Tuscan sausage here, cheesy polenta there, an egg and bacon bap but it’s pancetta on panuozzo, but elsewhere expect to see unpretentious cooking of the [Arabella](https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/72522/arabella-boxer.html) school, like pease pudding, chicken soups, haggis on toast, meatloaf. Don’t leave without a copy of the charming Italo booklet which sums up its spirit, documenting new produce, community activities, and services for hire.",

The first — the amateur way — is as a sit down restaurant of outstanding Peshawari grills and karahis, everything made fresh and cooked to order by a chef as serenely self-assured as 40 Maltby Street’s Stephen Williams. The second — the go big or go home way — requires some advance notice and a posse of lamb lovers ready to demolish the dum pukht of slow cooked mutton steamed with a sealant of dough, or the whole lamb sajji, which is served resembling a plaster cast of a Pompeii victim, stuffed with rice and a steal at £200 a lamb (plus £30 “corkage” — lambage? — to eat in). Assuming most people are posse-less, make sure there’s enough people to try the mixed grill, in which, unusually, chicken wings are the highlight: tender, spicy, charred; everything wings promise and never are. Or the wreta, chops of mutton weighty with marrow that can be pushed out onto small canoes of naan. Chapli kebabs are exceptional versions — loosely minced, pillow soft and juicy, with coarsely chopped tomato — every bit the equal of Namak Mandi’s, while the eponymous lamb charsi karahi is mildly but cleverly spiced. In a major concession to vegetarianism, the charsi karahi can also be ordered with chicken instead of lamb.",

What’s happened to Brixton can be a warning sign for Tooting, but for now modern British and small plates sidle up to diaspora cafes eking out a living at what Jonathan Gold would call the “centre of entry-level capitalism.” Chef Jojo Manalo is one of these cafes: one of three tiny Filipino spots in the market, and currently the best. A regular caterer for Chelsea Football Club, Manalo’s food tends towards the homestyle items even London’s more progressive Filipino chefs miss — a whole whiteboard of -silogs, the breakfasts of sticky garlic rice and fried eggs. Pair them with magenta bullets of sweet longanisa — longsilog — made in house, or oily white fish, split in two and crisped up on the grill — bangsilog. The whiteboard promises specials like pork nilaga, whose soothing garlic and white pepper broth adds necessary levity to rich mains and an astonishingly good kare-kare. Oxtail disintegrates from the bone and melts into sauce sweet with peanut butter and briny from a concentrated, salty hit of chilli and shrimp paste. There are many great dishes in the market, but Manalo’s kare kare is worth a journey all of its own.",

Her grandmother used to soak pounds of vine fruits for a minimum of 12 months in copious amounts of Wray and Nephew rum, which would be pulverised into a smooth paste lending the cake it’s distinctively moist texture and decadently boozy flavour. Whilst Jackie was tweaked the original recipe, it remains faithful in this respect: a blend of slowly aged booze soaked fruits, nostalgia and longing, contributing equally to what makes this cake so good. It regularly features on the counter at the bakery where it is available by the slice, however Jackie has also made this cake as a bespoke six tier wedding cake.",

The mixture instead rises up, writhing and ripping to create thick, craggy cookies with a strong, walled crust and a sunken, squidgy centre housing all manner of playful additions.",

After fleeing the Kurdish genocide of the late 1980s, Baban spent time living in Iranian (Eastern) Kurdistan, before moving to London. The food at Nandine reflects these travels across the Kurdish culinary scene: for example, stewed aubergine tapsi may be typical to Iraqi Kurdish food, but it is served over a refreshing dill fragranced rice that is unmistakably Persian in palette.",

Made with wholemeal rye flour from Cann Mills, Fen Farm Dairy butter, Original Beans Cru Virunga 70 percent dark chocolate, dark muscovado sugar, and an unapologetic amount of sea salt, these dome-shaped beauties are rich and satisfying with an intense, complex chocolate flavour and delicately sour tang. E5’s triple chocolate cookies are comprised of very similar ingredients, except for browning the butter for additional richness, replacing dark muscovado with light, and including three types of chocolate from Original Beans rather than just one — to radically different effect. The result is a flatter, evenly spread cookie with a high chocolate percentage and a clear distinction between solid chocolate chunks and rich cookie dough. There’s also a vegan version, which swaps the butter for Honest Toil olive oil and includes a blend of buckwheat flour and light spelt flour for a satisfyingly chewy texture.",

      "description": "For many, the best Thai restaurant in London; for some dedicated fans, one of the best in the game in any cuisine at any price point right now. Chef Sirichai Kularbwong’s blackboard of joy is updated daily, spanning the rich diversity of southern Thai food, from his inimitable moo krob, sticky with chilli and caramelised chunks of pork belly, to rich curries, and herbal soups. The menu will depend on what the chef and his parents, who have run this restaurant in Leytonstone for 20 years without fanfare, have picked up that day. Look out for whole steamed sea bass, prepared almost Teochew style with ginger and pickled plum, a god-tier iteration of green curry with wobbly beef shortrib, mind-bending fruit salads that expertly marry funk with the sweetness of strawberry or mangosteen, or fierce but balanced curries made with razor clams, gigantic heads-on prawns, fresh crab meat, and — best of all — soft, rosy liver. Tip: order “Thai spicy.”",

It changes regularly, too, making it even harder to define a single must-have bite-sized dish. If the *moo krob* (crispy pork belly with chilli and basil) is on, it’s nine pounds very well spent, but for £2.50 less, the crispy quail is arguably the leading bargain on what is already an astonishingly good-value menu. There’s definitely an affinity with the legendary chargrilled version at the Vietnamese Sông Quê Café on Haggerston’s Kingsland Road — there’s a generous hand with the white pepper, a similar violent thrill in tearing something so tiny apart by hand and tooth. But Singburi’s version has two clear advantages: one, it’s fried, in a crunchy, aromatic batter. And two, it comes with a much more robust, Northern-Thai-style dipping sauce of ground toasted chilli and lime juice. If visiting with friends, one bird each should do nicely.",

Immaculate oysters and Cantabrian anchovies are just as likely to kick things off these days as pig’s head terrine; the gentle influence of Campania (the restaurant round the corner, maybe also the Italian region) can be felt on a list of pastas that seems to only improve with age.

However, N16 cookie connoisseurs convinced they’ve seen it all will be surprised and charmed by the newest addition to the baked goods selection: a chocolate, fir tip, and rye cookie that embodies Christmas. Esters makes a fir tip sugar that smells of Christmas trees and peppermint candy canes, by turns citrussy and resinous, making up the base of the cookies alongside two types of chocolate — Pump Street 75 percent Jamaica and Chocolat Madagascar 62 percent Madagascar — and rye flour from Hodmedods.

The three course set menu is more than enough for a hearty iftar, and then some. A good order would be something like the shammi kebabs, Bengali Malaikari prawns, and carrot halwa. When booking a table, just inform them that the meal is for iftar.",

Located in a Covent Garden backstreet, this new venue is owned by former supperclub hosts Prabir Kumar Chattopadhyay and Biswajit Deb Das. Jhalmuri — Bengal’s answer to bhel puri — is tangy with tamarind, tart with green mangoes, and pungent with mustard oil, perked up by the crunchy bite of peanuts and popped rice. Aubergine fillets come draped in mustard sauce with a side gig of black chickpeas and tomato-red chilli chutney. Minced lamb khichuri is comforting as a grandma’s hug; and cod fishcake comes with kasundi — the classic Bengali mustard relish that’s the current darling of Indian and non-Indian chefs in London.",

The menu is massive, so not everything comes off — the classic gobi manchurian is disappointing, for instance — but among the more successful dishes are the exquisitely moreish okra with salt and pepper, 1960s-style chilli chicken fiery with green chillies, tender tilapia steamed with soy sauce and ginger, and beef stir-fried with water chestnuts and dried red chillies.

Originally from Kolkata, Lee learnt how to cook Indo-Chinese at the legendary China Garden in Mumbai, another restaurant with split menu loyalties (one half Cantonese and the other being Indo-Chinese). China Garden is also the birthplace of the chicken manchurian, an iconic dish based on the staple flavours of the Bengali larder — green chilli, ginger and garlic — with soy sauce, vinegar and cornstarch replacing garam masala. Manchurian is on Hakkaland’s menu along with a litany of Desi-Chinese prefixes: sapo, soya wine, Tai Pai, Szechuan (always with a ‘z’), and Hunan — a sauce made from a huge amount of pickled ginger that has absolutely nothing to do with Hunan. Hakkaland has a large following outside the UK: customers can watch Lee’s appearances on Indian TV which are played on the wall while they eat flawless versions of Kolkata chilli chicken and Tai Pai (Taipei) paneer.",

Tripe (bhutan) can be ordered stir fried but is even better in the deep fried crispy version, coming out as Cthulhu-like tentacles, crisper than chicharron due to the high fat content and the surface area where each frill has turned into a little spike of batter. Of note are also the chatamari, often called Nepali pizzas by people who have never seen a pizza. In actual fact these rice crepes are more like Vietnamese banh xeo, stuffed with beans, potato and chicken mince and served with a mutton curry on the side to cut through the stodge. If any Nepali restaurant in Woolwich is worth the DLR ride it’s this one.",

This is not pie by its usual signifiers — the pastry instead a melting wager on the tongue — but this is what makes it. It is a pie into which a perfectly dressed salad might be dipped, as well as or instead of the usual starch. Which is great, because you want to save room for the honey and brown butter tart at dessert.",

Good chippies know that to survive they have to change, which is why Cod Fellas has a whole board of vegan options, the best of which is the tofish. It uses layers of tofu that coagulate into something approximating fish flakes, and is consequently bland when poorly done, but here it comes as a whole battered monolith, around the size and thickness of a good novella, with a crackly layer of nori on the bottom that both mimics fish skin and fools the tastebuds into registering marine notes.

Nigeria’s version of shawarma, a popular dish across the country, however, does not require meat from a rotating spit, and refers mainly to the idea of grilled, spiced meat wrapped inside a flatbread. It is the same meat that is used in suya — fatty and charred, but more thinly sliced. At Alhaji Suya, diners can choose tozo (fatty beef), beef, lamb, or chicken, and as in the Levant, lamb works well. Accompanying it are saveloy-esque chicken hot dogs (a nostalgic surprise); fresh shredded red cabbage; a luscious sauce made from mayonnaise, tomato and garlic; and a sprinkling of fiery yaji to cut through the sweetness. A trip without tasting the tozo suya would be a little foolish, so come very hungry!",

With its angular edges, cold surfaces, and museum-like build, the space itself breaks the mould and immediately sets a very different tone from most other east London haunts. It’s a space that, necessarily, mirrors the integrity of what comes out of the kitchen — ambitious food from head chef Sebastien Meyers that’s dreamt up with equal parts nostalgia and ingenuity, skilfully realised. At Planque there are moments of creative brilliance that produce some of the best cooking in London. \n\nFood of such aptitude requires wine to suit, and the list at Planque provides exceedingly well. From an immense grower Champagne selection to back vintages of some of the finest Savennieres chenin blanc, to the grand Barolos of Rinaldi, there’s no shortage of tremendously exciting wines to drink from this list, so long as one’s pocketbook allows it. Entry-level wines are available but it’s worth splurging on a list like this, often featuring wines from owner Jonathan Alphandery’s personal collection and as such have been immaculately curated and cellared. For many, Planque may live in the space of special-occasion restaurants, but in this case, the cost comes with tremendous reward.",

It shys away from the regular optics of a Jamaican jerk outpost in favour of white sleek interiors, plant pots and astro turf flooring, all befitting the garden moniker, which makes visiting the shop a refreshing experience.

But Norman’s, between Tufnell Park and Archway — is a “British cafe” with soul to match the aesthetics, both forward looking and in touch with the city’s cultural roots it takes nourishment from. Brilliantly brewed coffee from Dark Arts comes in a big mug — filter is the choice here — to be slurped alongside butties, fry-ups, and specials like bolognese on chips.",

There’s confidence in a space like this, built into its concept and execution, and now that’s carried over to a quick and straightforward little wine list for those looking to expand their brunch routine. The list is simple, approachable, and everything on it functions in the world of “breakfast wine.” As it should.",

      "description": "This old-school British caff located on an unassuming stretch in Tuffnell Green is a cut above average and comes from Elliott Kaye and Richie Hayes, who ditched jobs at some of London’s top restaurants to open the platonic ideal of a caff based on a deep admiration of British food culture. Norman’s Café serves simple, comforting nostalgic food that speaks to childhood teatime favourites, builders’ breakfasts and old-fashioned cravings with a degree of hipster cool but not an ounce of irony — the honesty is in the prices. Alongside set breakfasts, cheesy beans on toast and dishes like ham, egg and chips or battered fish sandwich, there are weekly retro puds. The Tottenham Cake with bright pink icing served in a bowl full of custard, inspired by one of Hayes’s primary school dinner puddings, is unmissable. The sponge is like a soft pocket spring mattress of vanilla sheet cake topped with thick, glossy pink-red icing that is far less saccharine than its vivid colour suggests. The custard is pure ambrosial comfort and served at the precise, pleasantly lukewarm temperature where it will begin to form a skin if the diner doesn’t dig straight in. Norman’s is open 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. Wednesday — Sunday, but weekends attract crowds from all over London so arrive early to avoid disappointment.",

The restaurant recommends ordering a plate — which means more toppings — for the full experience of mixing, matching, and constructing the ideal bite. The lamb itself is tender enough, really flavoursome, with a satisfying char on the outside. The charred fluffy bread gets slightly wetter than one might hope underneath the meat, but not too wet to get to work on building the goods. All the fillings have their place: velvety tahini sauce; smokey, spicy slightly and sweet harissa; fresh undressed herbs with shredded red cabbage; sumac-dressed onions; tangy hot green peppers; and then the highlights: Sweet, turmeric pickled cucumbers with a perfectly conceived level of delicate tang; and cumin salt which really ties the whole experience together. Cauliflower shawarma can be ordered as a side. Here it isn’t really shawarma, but for the smokiness on the outside which somewhat resembles the experience of eating shawarma. Pine nuts, and pomegranate and dried rose petals as toppings do make it a deliciously aromatic thing to eat, however, even if a little more tahini sauce underneath would be welcome.",

Satyajit Ray would have been a better choice… Though that would have made for somewhat gloomier ambience. It’s a surprise this Bengali-owned, New York-based chain hasn’t turned into a London chain yet, packed as it is with Indians (and non-Indians) of every age and background. The tightly wrapped paratha rolls are as slim as fat cigars, stuffed with judiciously spiced fillings ranging from potatoes and eggs, to shrimp, and mutton. Try a selection of two or three, along with mishti doi lassi, the classic Bengali dessert of yoghurt and date palm jaggery that’s here been turned into a drink. An amped-up sandwich and a drinkable dessert is the secret to a good life.",

Chicken and lamb shawarma can be ordered as a wrap, but that would mean missing out on ordering them as a plate with salad, pickles, and potatoes. The flavour in both meats is outstanding, with the sweet cinnamon kick in the lamb particularly appealing. Ordered this way, the meat comes two ways. It is stuffed with velvety toum into a khobez — cut into three or four pieces — that has been seared in the excess fat dripping from the vertical spit; or laid on slices of the same flatbread, lathered with a spicier red toum, as well as some pomegranate molasses and black and white sesame seeds. Arguably outshining the shawarma are the potatoes: Flat and oval, they are somewhere between a crisp and a chip, and sprinkled on top of them is a secret spice mix that is addictively sapid. Do not forget to ask for fiery, fermented shatta — it’s fiery and complex and only adds another layer to the flavour ensemble in the mouth. And, probably order the broasted chicken, which is surely one of the best fried chicken experiences available in London.",

In reality, the cafe specialises in that much broader category: things on rice. Grilled beef or pork are well marinated and tender, coming with the kiss of char from the grill, and might form a rice bowl with a fried egg and some chilli, or a tangle of steamed bun noodles with bouncy meatballs, salad and fish sauce. Better yet, is the bò kho, a Vietnamese beef stew redolent of good home cooking: tender brisket offering no resistance to a plastic spoon, with thick batons of carrot glistening with fat and greedily sucking up all the slow-cooked flavour from the meat, proving the cross-cultural truth that the best part of long meat cooking is the starchy vegetables. On Friday night, Sonia prepares phở for Saturday morning until it sells out. It is an outstanding version: blushing rare beef that gently loses its shame in the soup, darker pieces of well done meat, and homemade meatballs, all in a sweet, southern style broth.

If a regular chicken broth is liquid penicillin then a chicken soup from Coldharbour Lane’s The Bread of Life is the Astrazeneca jab in a carton. The soups and porridges change daily: the sweet peanut porridge on a Friday has the smooth, creamy texture of grits, soothed with the balm of nutmeg, a taste of childhood no matter the background. And while the sign on the door says man cannot live on bread alone, it’s possible to live solely on the fried dumplings, instantly identifiable on sight by their Escher braid, and in the mouth by their sugar snap coating that yields to the lightest, fluffiest dough.

Egusi, that ingenious seed, thirstily soaks up soup and coalesces into curds that are often compared to scrambled eggs or ricotta but should only ever be compared to egusi.

The Anzac is fair game for the best of its kind in the city — a vast domed frisbee of oats, coconut, burnt butter and golden syrup, substantial and wholesome enough to call breakfast but undeniably decadent. Meanwhile the khorasan, tahini, chocolate chip cookie engages customers in Milk’s favourite game of ingredients one has to surreptitiously look up. The ancient variety of wheat named after the Khorasan region of northern Iran brings its qualities to a tried-and-tested flavour combination, with the earthy wholewheat flour underscoring the nuttiness of tahini and vast chunks of Pump Street chocolate to establish this as a cookie for serious connoisseurs.",

Better still is the seco norteño, a slow-cooked stew of beef and potato, coloured ditchwater green-brown by the aggressive use of coriander. The non-chifa dishes are well worth ordering too — ceviche is fresh, well-cured and bracingly acidic as part of a trimarinero, while anticuchos come correct as tender parchments of beef heart, marinated with the sting of aji amarillo.

That same relationship also means that Prufrock was the first to feature Postcard’s new range of stone-rolled teas: ground to a fine powder in Postcard’s Camden warehouse, the teas are mixed with steamed milk to create an aromatic alternative to coffee.",

The introduction of a precisely engineered but deeply pleasurable affogato and the return of some of Europe’s most exciting roasters on the retail shelves recaptures some of the fun, moderately chaotic energy that made it \\*the\\* London coffee shop of the 2010s.",

There’s a certain Frenchness, from baguettes through terrines and the provenance of natural wines on offer. But then, techniques and traditions from across the channel pervade British cuisine, and the essence of the food here is that of so many restaurants on this list: seasonal vegetables, rich heritage-breed meats, local farmhouse cheeses. Save for its extraordinary cooked ham, the menu (scrawled on one blackboard, of course) is never the same. Recent highlights include carrot, crab and monk’s beard broth, oyster fritters with laverbread mayonnaise, and a celeriac and Ardrahan pie.",

On the blackboard, it’s not just the words themselves but the unseen dark matter between them: a judicious, stealthy additional ingredient here; an unassuming-sounding assembly there that is in fact the standout dish. On the plate, it’s the flawlessness of Steve Williams’ all-around game that soon becomes apparent: the mastery of a range of techniques (especially deep-frying and anything involving pastry) that most cooks would be content to deliver at 7/10 standard. And in the glass, it’s the sense that these are wines made for, and by, a community: not an exclusive clique, but a like-minded collective that sees the sort of wine that Gergovie curates and the sort of food that Williams cooks as two sides of the same coin. So: 40 Maltby Street, the best restaurant in London? Maybe. But it’s also so much more than that.",

In recent years, owner Eren Korkmaz has overseen the refurbishments to keep them in the Green Lanes arms race and now, like Antepliler, Hala has become a triple shopfront behemoth. Luckily quality has not been compromised: diners in the mood for meat should try the adana kebabs, *kaburga* (ribs) and *pirzola* (chops), mopped up with bread blessed with the juices and fat from the grill, but groups should make room for the excellent versions of icli kofte and manti dumplings instead of ordering starters. Solo eaters should also consider the paca corbasi; the Platonic ideal of a meat soup taken to its rich, buttery extreme, only achievable by careful stewing of gelatinous sheep’s foot.",

The original can still be found on Green Lanes at Hala: seemingly about a hundred tiny dumplings covered in yoghurt and chilli oil, way too rich for one person to eat but a perfect thing to order for the table. Across the road at Gozleme House, it’s possible to buy them frozen by the kilo to make at home (top tip: they go really well with Lao Gan Ma chilli oil fried in butter).",

There will (almost) always be radishes with taramasalata (with more of that olive oil.)

That gets precisely laminated on the second day, before finally being filled with rich, rum-boosted almond frangipane cream concealing the hidden fève on the third day. Sharp scoring, hot-stone baking, and generous glazing result in a glistening burnished finish that faithfully resembles a crown. Miel Bakery will also offer a weekend special galette, filled with Piedmont hazelnut praline and dotted with 64 percent Valrhona Manajari chocolate, but the traditional Galette des Rois will be available throughout January for pre-order collection, nationwide shipping, and limited in-store purchase at the bakery.",

However, cardamom coffee is a cornerstone of the drinks menu at Honey & Co, and so it made sense to Srulovich and Packer that the trinity of coffee, cardamom and walnut would make for a splendid cake.

Most of all, though, the crowds are in it for the Sunday specials. The two heavy hitters are lechon al horno, roasted pork served in grid-formation with sweet potato, plantain, rice, huge-kerneled choclo corn, and fresh cheese; and falso conejo, false rabbit, a dish of deep-fried beef cutlets served in a sauce of tomatoes, peas, and onions. At Jenecheru, it’s accompanied by two types of potato — white, and white chuño*,* a kind of freeze-dried potato, as well as rice, tomatoes, and onions. The dish likely gets its name from its resemblance to lambreado de conejo, a fried rabbit dish, which might be served whole and regal, or in pieces, and dressed with the same sauce.",

A huge range of wines is searchable by price point and style; there is no minimum order and delivery can be arranged within the hour (and can even be on ice).

At 10 Cases that formula’s honed with great charm, even going so far as to replicate the street-facing, tightly packed wicker bistro chairs and marble tables wedged between. Prices prove surprisingly reasonable for the postcode, and while the by the glass options seem rather safe, there’s plenty of fun to be had in the full wine list, where wines from the exceptional Masseria del Pino can be drunk at near-retail prices, or, should the weather cooperate, one can enjoy the fabulous view of the Tesco Express with a bottle of summery perfection in the form of Jean Maupertuis’s Pink Bulles.

This part of Clerkenwell is inexplicably filled with questionable gyros and souvlaki joints, but the cleverness of Catalyst is to use expected ingredients in unexpected ways. Take the katsu sando, which is at heart a halloumi sandwich, except here three fingers have been breaded Birdseye style and come with a fried egg, plum ketchup, politiki — a pickled version of a cabbage salad whose name refers to Constantinople — and a coffee sriracha made from the grounds of whatever coffee is just in. In a single sandwich, references to Greece, Turkey, the UK, Australia and Thailand. The other sandwiches are as good: tartare sauce on thick cut bacon and egg; sausage with gravy and pickles; black pudding with XO sauce and Ogleshield oozing like cheese wiz; but it’s the bar snacks on late Thursday and Friday that set them apart in ambition. Whether it’s marinated raw prawns with persimmon and chestnut, monkfish with a pasta made from trahanas, a ferment of grains and dairy, or a whole côte de boeuf cooked on open flame, it’s soon apparent that Catalyst is not just a coffee shop, and is putting out some of the most inventive food in the Holborn/Clerkenwell area.",

To go with the pasta, Chamam carries the lessons of Palestinian chicken mousakhan — where flatbread is used to soak up the aromatic juices — across dishes, whether the bread is nestled beneath chicken, lamb tongue tonnato, or octopus. There’s also a special talent for condiments at Catalyst that extends to all things jammy: from sumac confit onions to spiced, baked grapes, to emulsions made with staka, a sheep’s milk butter.

For homesick expats missing their native foods in London, these share a curious affinity with snack culture from the north of England and Scotland: any fried carbs available are stuffed in between soft barms; think samosas, vadas, bhajis, along with various puris and wraps sprinkled with sev and Desi-Chinese curries. The paneer bomb, a light tomato curry of paneer, stuffed into bread and then deep fried, is an innovation any Glaswegian chippy would be proud of.",

Lesser-known Indian vegetables like ivy gourd and cluster beans, rarely seen on London menus, are also available.

Look out for weekend specials like pearl millet flatbreads, fresh pigeon pea kadhi, and a fairly decent rendition of Swaminarayan khichdi: rice and toor dal cooked with lots of vegetables and spices in a famous version of the dish created by Ahmedabad’s Swaminarayan temple in the early twentieth century.",

No, it’s the lamb kouzi and kebab skewers that are thrilling; but sometimes comforts come before thrills, and that’s when the usually reserved bamia speaks up. A warming plateful of steamed rice served with a tangy and ever-so-slightly crunchy tomato and okra stew feels like eating a hug, and makes even the coldest afternoon sunsets a bit more bearable. The bamia isn’t just basic; it is essential. —***Maazin Buhari***",

Thickened by lightly toasted ground egusi, the soup is almost buoyant in texture and clings onto every morsel of pounded yam or eba that’s thrown its way. —***Lucas Oakeley***",

Counterintuitively, Wimpy Bexleyheath also feels more loved than its 19 refurbished cousins, which can be found in places like Streatham, Bermondsey and Watney Market. The restaurant occupies an extraordinary, mirror-filled room, with cushioned fixed seating and dramatic moulded plastic booths, with the same colour scheme as the opening sequence of *Saved by the Bell*. The staff are friendly and attentive too, offering table service with a smile.\n\nWimpy burgers are basically burger van burgers, mass-produced versions of the ones at football matches. So eating at a Wimpy is a uniquely un-American experience, in contrast to McDonald’s and Burger King, with vinegar on every table and burger sauce always close at hand; chips are chips, not “fries”. Fascinatingly, this specific Wimpy has regulars too: on weekday evenings, groups of people chat over soft drinks, as if they’re at the pub.",

Interestingly, this sit-down chippy’s menu also extends well beyond traditional battered fish and deep-fried potato fare, to include fry-ups, sandwiches, and even pie and mash. So Something Fishy is an all-purpose, Swiss Army knife of a restaurant, which caters to all the people visiting and working in Lewisham Market. Since it’s so affordable, Something Fishy is a place where customers should push the boat out. Don’t settle for a hunk of fish and a mountain of chips; get the gravy, some gherkins, a pot of curry sauce, a battered sausage, and a crunchy disc of cod roe.",

There’s vintage ads, posters, ceiling fans, novelty clocks and random bits of rare and unusual Elvis memorabilia.\n\nHere, the basics are safe bets, like the £5.40 fry-up, which conceals a fried slice beneath its egg like a surprise grease bomb.

The place has an eclectic, old-fashioned menu, with unusual options like duck eggs, spotted dick, and an Irish breakfast, which includes white pudding and excludes baked beans. Like a Scottish breakfast, the Irish at Mary’s is a reminder that fried breakfasts are really just a whole lot of pork, fried and arranged on a plate.\n\nIt’s worth eating all that pork at Mary’s because of the quality of its meat. The white pudding is a hockey puck of oaty, bloodless fat with a hint of offal; the sausages are real too — plump, herb-speckled things like the ones at E Pellicci and Regency Cafe. At lunchtime, the steak and kidney pie comes softened beneath a puddle of gravy, its pastry casing filled to the brim with tender chunks of beef.",

The standard of cooking here is inconsistent, and the food is at its best when Preeti is in the kitchen. Betraying its origins as a pub, the venue continues to attract mostly male diners that once flocked to the place for drinks; but it’s also hugely popular with students, families, dating couples, and Londoners in the know for whom it’s the best-known South Indian in the area.\n\nEveryone comes here for the fry dishes: Chicken fry, in which the bird on the bone is batter-fried until crisp and golden and showered with plentiful wisps of fried sliced shallots and curry leaves. Another notable dish is whole, gently spiced tomato paste-marinated tilapia steamed in banana leaves. There’s little here for vegetarians, and in fact the restaurant has been steadily removing meat-free dishes from its menu due to lack of demand — apparently vegetarians go to the area’s many other meat-free restaurants. (This seems unusual, but observant Hindus like their food to be ‘pure vegetarian’, cooked in separate kitchens or even in separate establishments altogether — which has prompted many South Indian chains to launch separate veg and non-veg branches).",

Kailash Momo near the station is one of the busiest in the area, and the extensive menu has something for everyone, soaking up Tibetan, Nepali, Indian, and Chinese influences. The namesake momos are actually not the strongest point; better to get set lunches of “crazy” fried meats to be eaten with dried chiura (flattened rice), as well as generous thalis with adroitly spiced lamb, chickpea and lentil curries and pickled potatoes (aloo ko achar).

For one, there’s no menu given at this Jamaican seafood restaurant; instead, it is stuck up on the far wall near a fridge. Actually, there’s no real indication of what to do at all. So here it is: walk directly to that fridge, and pick a fish — red snapper, bream, and sea bass among others.

It remains the benchmark for Italian food outside of Italy, producing bagna cauda, risotto verde, and fritto misto to challenge the most wizened trattorie.",

This extraordinarily rich, mousse-like cake contains just 4 ingredients — eggs, butter, sugar and chocolate — and is cooked bain-marie style by placing the cake tin in a second baking tin partially filled up with hot water, ensuring it cooks slowly to a super smooth, silky consistency. The recipe is widely available and many restaurants nod to the restaurant by putting Chocolate Nemesis on their menus, but the River Café is working with Original Beans to develop an exclusive nemesis chocolate blend which would place this often-replicated dessert beyond imitation. It’s always on the menu, and the super-fans can order a whole one online.",

Emmer and oat crunchie biscuits are a take on head baker Janine Edwards’s childhood memories of eating crunchies in South Africa, with the addition of wholegrain emmer flour milled on-site lending a honeyed, nutty complexity to a traditional recipe featuring oats and golden syrup. The tahini cookies, meanwhile, were recently removed from the menu to make space for new bakes but are expected to return due to customer demand. These intensely nutty dome-shaped cookies made with a mixture of light and dark tahini and unhulled sesame seeds from Oliveology have a unique halva-like consistency, all enveloped in a crumbly caramelised crust, making them something of a one-of-a-kind cookie in a saturated field.",

The opening salvo of snacks and fried stuff marries finesse with a serious whack of chilli heat; chicken, seafood and paneer emerge impeccably blackened from the tandoor to follow; mains run the gauntlet from Southern Indian curries (don’t miss the cashew and pepper chicken) to a selection of the group’s justly famed biryani. There is a “Taste of Trishna” menu available, but the move is absolutely to go à la carte and overorder so dramatically that there’s plenty left over to take away.",

The second is those who view the success of a pizza in terms of how many of the toppings would make an Italian nonna cry. Antonio Pellone, with two generations of pizzaiolos behind him on Lavender Hill, may look like the former but is secretly the latter. Yes his margherita is great, his cornicione blistered and his dough both light and digestible, but it’s the second menu of sauceless white “gourmet” pizzas where he shows his mastery. An outstanding signature pizza cossets folds of fatty mortadella offset by the sweetness of a pistachio pesto, hot pink and lemon yellow, perhaps a tribute to Mr Blobby. Or the *bufalina gialla*, a dance with acidity, lactic from the buffalo mozzarella, malic from sweet yellow datterini, and citric from a spritz of lemon zest. These are inventive, playful pizzas, one degree away from trad but flawlessly executed — even a nonna might laugh, not cry.",

Onions, sumac, and parsley cut through, and then a generous platter of lemons and tiny pickles and chillis brings even more acidity. A single lavash is £3, a double £3.50; in fluffier bread it’s £6. There is nothing else on the menu.",

Beef is boiled, seasoned with the likes of tomato, pul biber, sumac, and cumin and subsequently fried in cotton oil before being loaded, meat juices aplenty, inside a thin lavash with chopped parsley, tomato, and onion. It is then given a pleasing bend before being eaten; a selection of high-acid accompaniments — pickled chillis, lemon — provide the necessary cut-through.",

A community in hiding, they created a poultry sausage that could hang from their ceilings, just as Christians dried and displayed their pork sausages.

Or an escalope the size of Dominic Cummings’s head crowned with salty cheese, or that old stager beef roulade stuffed with bacon and gherkins.

At Sowa, where the pierogi are made at a counter in full view of patrons — note the conspicuous bags of extra-fine Polish flour — they’re twice the size of tired supermarket varieties, and rich fillings are balanced by a substantial rope of springy dough at the hand-closed edges. It’s as good as these underrated little dumplings get. Sowa serves one of the UK’s oldest Polish communities, in Ealing, and the upholstered chairs and monogrammed windows seem suited to the central European business-type. There is a good patisserie attached, where you can find the preserve-packed doughnuts known as Pączki.",

Miod Malina, a charming farmhouse-style cafe in North Acton, does these soups very well.

Indeed, it might be the hippest restaurant in central London. Hordes of immaculately dressed shoppers and students gather for hot pots, whole fish in chilli oil, numbing Chongqing noodles, cumin-studded grilled skewers, and Chinese hamburgers while competing with the staff for the coolest look. This extremely trendy restaurant is a scene all of its own, but not unwelcoming; it’s perfect for either a date or a group booking.",

And while it has seen its status shift since then from *enfant terrible* to local hero to worldwide icon to national treasure, it shows precious little signs of growing old gracefully. Kidneys hum with the same tang and devil of old; rarebits, pies and sweetbreads still taste as elementally satisfying as they did the first time round (everyone remembers their first time). If anything, the passing years have allowed people to appreciate St John for what it truly is: not a John-Bullish temple to guts and gluttony, but a singular testament to the ongoing effort and creativity of a team working both within and without the British culinary tradition.",

Groups sit inside under the bower of an artificial cherry blossom tree (Albalou means sour cherry) with a stuffed peacock staring out imperiously from the corner. There are also a few tables roadside for singles and pairs. The tahdig on the menu is a generous golden nest of rich and crispy rice, which can be ordered on its own as a side, or with stew. It pairs particularly well with the refreshing herbs and acidic dried limes of ghormeh sabzi. To be clear, this isn’t particularly authentic. It’s not common to find a dish of pure tahdig (just the goods at the bottom of the pot) without the accompanying mass of fluffy rice in a Persian household.

The restaurants here, by and large, have the same menu: the same marinated skewers, the same one or two stews, the same one or two fragrant rices. Eram Shishlik stands out not just for its strangely bougie cafe interior but for the aberration on the recited list of meats: lamb neck. It takes a huge amount of confidence to put a neck on the menu and serve it simply, knowing that people will order it regardless. Not only is it a cheap cut; when it arrives, it is quite unmistakably a neck: three fragile vertebrae surrounded by knotty meat that has been slow cooked until it comes apart in guitar strings of flesh, all wobbly fat and sinew basted in what seems like a vat of butter, onions, and saffron. It absolutely demands careful picking apart, scraping at the bone with fork and finally teeth, sucking out the marrow from the now completely fleshless vertebrae. This is cooking completely without ego: no searing hot grill, no complex marinade, just careful preparation and time. It’s the kind of exceptional home cooking everyone secretly craves when eating out.",

It is relatively smooth, with some texture and bite, and an abundance of lingering herbal, spicy, garlicky flavour. Accompany it with a tamer hindi “mocktail,” whose tamarind acidity and rosewater fragrance makes for a refreshing contrast, and if not just there for the hummus, it is worth ordering from the “home cooking” section.

      "description": "If looking for Lebanese food in Northeast London, this is the spot, and the shawarma is good, evidenced by the well-layered spits of chicken and lamb, topped with a surface of fat, and crowned with lemons. Diners can order a mixed plate with some very tasty vermicelli rice for £14, but the wrap — at £6.75 for mixed, £6.49 for lamb, or £6.20 for chicken — is better value-for-money, and offers a fuller shawarma experience. Both the lamb and chicken are crisp on the outside and moist enough on the inside, speckled with some of their spices: ginger and cumin for the chicken; cinnamon and cumin for the lamb. The toum is rich and appropriately garlicky, and the chilli sauce mild but flavoursome. The winning accompaniment here is the dill-pickled cucumber, which has a curious, intricate flavour. If opting to dine in for a full meal, add on the pomegranate-laced chicken livers, which are not to be missed.",

There’s an extensive grill list, but for even more delicious rice, try the baqala polo, rice with broad beans and dill, with lamb shank.

The raw materials for greatness are there: Ciro’s dough yields an incomparably light, supple crust, the base for world-class sourcing and baking technique. But building a Westminster team of pizzaioli that can make it *his* way, at all times, could prove a challenge. One of the beautiful artichoke and capocollo pizzas recently served fell flat on the edges, lacking the air-pocketed border one expects to see framing a Ciro Salvo pizza. It was good enough, which is to say, not quite good enough. When Ciro or a trusted sidekick are in London to stretch the 50 Kalò (“good dough” in Neapolitan slang), even a pizza as basic as a Marinara, with only tomato, oregano, garlic and extra virgin olive oil, is a thrill ride. Soaring flavours held aloft by a magic carpet woven with flour, yeast and water.",

Instead go for the doner kebab, which is made daily on the premises and filled with freshly chopped onion and parsley, a new addition to late-night memories of the slowly rotating elephant’s foot.",

Greek-Cypriot restaurant Vrisaki was opened in 1970 in the still Cypriot north London neighbourhood of Palmers Green, and where else can someone order a meze dish of hummus for £3.50? Cypriot hummus includes garlic in addition to lemon and tahini and it has a grainier texture than Lebanese hummus, closer to the Turkish variety that uses less tahini. Competing with the likes of tarama and tzatziki, it is loaded with garlic, though less so than the notoriously punchy tahini mezze (called tahini on the menu, but known in Greek as tashi.) If dining with a large group, it is best to order the hummus as part of the Vrisaski set meze, which offers a colossal amount of food for just £22.95, and can be followed by an equally generous main course servings of tsippoura (grey bream), keftedes (pork and beef meatballs)*,* or kleftiko (lamb shank slow-cooked in white wine).",

The historic site was originally set up by retired army officer Edward Palmer — its story is the stuff of legend that needs to be told another time, and perhaps turned into a BBC costume drama. Strikingly coloured glass chandeliers and decorative screens of maharajas’s palaces of the 1920s is the perfect backdrop to mulligatawny soup with an amazing depth of flavour, and fragrant lamb biryani — both of which are cooked to recipes from the original 1926 menu.

Pliant rotis are folded over each other as vehicles for curried meats and vegetables, but to come here and only order this would be missing half the fun. It’s actually all about the snacks, which immaculately juggle sweet, sour and savoury. So first of all, order the hot doubles, two fried bara, cumin scented chickpeas and shredded cucumber, with tamarind and pepper sauce on the side. Then the macaroni pie, hot and gooey, and crucially, flooded with tamarind sauce so it’s equally sweet and salty. It may be London’s only truly great mac and cheese. And then for the mains, not the regular roti but the buss-up-shot, a tangle of torn paratha, buttery and caramelised, to have with mashed pumpkin, again glistening with tamarind.

The roti are freshly made in house, folded into vast parcels of stewed chicken, sweet pumpkin, or curry goat. The hot doubles are smaller roti, filled with chickpea curry. The macaroni pie, though, is quietly one of the best things Roti Joupa has to offer. Crispy bubbles of sweet tamarind give way to silken, creamy pasta beneath, and at £1.50, there is little excuse not to order two. This food promises as much warmth as the Canada Goose jackets populating Clapham Common, but it’s much more cheering. Closed on Sundays.",

Translated as “swimming,” somewhat confusingly, in most of the Levant, msabbaha refers to unblended warm hummus, but here it refers to the spicy minced lamb sujik mix that swims on a silky hummus base. Even with a lighter base, there is no denying it is a hearty, sapid dish. It’s only served at weekends, alongside tiseeya bil samneh, a riot of chickpeas and pita chips in a yogurt tahini sauce topped with spices and hot ghee, and ful bil zeit: fava beans in olive oil. The sweets programme, however, runs all week, and it isn’t to be missed. Try the halawat el-jibn*,* a semolina and cheese skin filled with orange blossom-flavoured clotted cream, ashta; knaffeh nablusyiah (made with semolina, the original version of the dish hails from the Palestinian city of Nablus), and the slightly chewy-textured pistachio ice-cream.

A less confident restaurant would serve potted shrimp as they come, perhaps with some toast; a more thrustingly modern one might pile them on a crumpet with a ‘grammable garnish.

Tiernan closed the restaurant for much of 2020 and 2021 but has returned, a la Prince, with a new name and many of the old classics, including squid ink flatbread with smoked trout roe; lamb offal flatbread; and various well-travelled hunks of grilled protein imaginatively and judiciously seasoned.",

      "description": "Hearth Bakery’s baked goods are frequently built to reduce waste in the kitchen, and the latest cookie is a take on the famous speculoos spread, Biscoff. The Hackney Wick bakery’s version is made with leftover breadcrumbs that have already been used once, for making so-called “bread tea” — an infusion that can be reduced into “bread treacle” or turned into kvass. The soaked breadcrumbs are dehydrated, and then mixed with speculoos spices, creamed butter, and brown sugar, before being baked into a crumbly biscuit. Those biscuits are then simmered with whole milk, butter, and brown sugar, to form a rich base that can be blended into an otherworldly relaive of Biscoff spread. Half that spread gets mixed with Emmer flour, cinnamon, and egg, to be baked into soft speculoos cookies; the rest becomes the filling for a sandwich of those very cookies. The method is at once inspiring and intimidating, but the result is indisputably delicious.",

Using British-grown chickpeas and split fava beans from Hodmedods, the falafel are beautifully green and aromatic, with an abundance of coriander, mint, and parsley in the mix. They are thin and crispy, served in a bed of softening tahini sauce, and with a slice of lemon covered in a slightly smokey pul biber chilli, which merits squeezing on.

As the spit turns, a mixture of lamb fat, schmaltz and butter is continually basted on the meat, which has been spiced with kashmiri chilli, black pepper, turmeric and saffron.

The meat itself could be more charred but it is pretty well-cooked, and the spicing has a sweet touch. The toasting on the wrap is well judged too. What’s more is that the chefs endeavour to pair the meats with the ingredients that suit them best, as is done in Palestinian cuisine. Thus, whilst the chicken comes with toum, the lamb comes with tahini sauce, tomato, raw onion, and tangy pickles. The shatta is tangy and sour, with the heat almost background, and is worth ordering on the side for the occasional dip.

The dim sum is fine; the litany of British-Chinese dishes is no better or worse than anywhere else nearby. Instead, look at the dish that disrupts it: hot and spicy potatoes. Chinese cuisine’s bedrock of rice and noodles hides the fact its potato preparations are simply elite, and these come as thick, brassy wedges, smoky from the wok, with spring onions, coriander and the concentrated umami of approximately 1000 black beans detonating in the mouth. The potatoes are alternately crispy and fudgy when hot, but are even better after an overnight stay in the fridge, perhaps soaked in chilli oil and dipped in Kewpie for a luxurious breakfast (in bed.)",

Some of the city’s best Ital food can be found at Zionly Manna inside the Rye Lane Indoor Market, once Peckham’s main shopping centre but now often more used for music videos. Jahson Peat’s food wears all its influences lightly ─ sometimes pan-African, sometimes just Peckham ─ from Jamaican dumplings made with wholemeal flour, to Ethiopian-ish vegetarian stews, to a vegan, low salt, low spice ethos that shares the strictures of Jainist food. The menu changes every day, but it’s possible to fill up on multiple items and a fresh fruit drink for around a tenner: make sure to get pasta and noodles if they’re on, and creamy butter beans which have more vitality than anything found at a Chelsea cafe.",

Bite into the bread, meeting resistance only at the barrier of escalope of its juices hotter than the sun, and gulp for fresh air.",

The menu is short but makes full use of the serious piece of kit in the back, a beautifully embossed custom grill on which chicken, pork, and best of all, goat, is introduced to the coals and become infused with smoke, with a pale-pink mantle that runs round the face of each piece of meat. Make sure to get their mild chilli sauce on the side, either with white slabs of ugali, an East African staple intimately known by many Indian families who came through Kenya or Uganda, or, better still, chapatis to wrap the meat.",

To understand the preference for soups laden with a finger thick layer of palm oil, look no further than Yakoyo Spot on Peckham High Street, also known as Ewenla Lounge. An egusi soup from Yakoyo Spot isn’t what [Chishuru’s Joké Bakare](https://vittles.substack.com/p/an-interview-with-adejok-bakare-of) would devastatingly dismiss with the par of ‘restaurant egusi’, but a proper buka egusi, with a 50-50 oil to egusi ratio. Only the most elegant of eaters would not leave their hands incarnadine, and only the most puritan wouldn’t spend a few minutes licking them clean. Aside from soups and starches, there is also ayamase. A bad ayamase, made carelessly with seeds or poor quality green peppers, can have a bitterness that mars the whole dish. Yakoyo Spot’s ayamase, though, is a joy forever: A showcase for the many qualities of iru, the fermented locust beans which give the stew a dark chocolate and tobacco muskiness; a fleeting impression of sweetness before the aftertaste of petrichor kicks in. It is served with beef and tripe, all swimming in oil the same luminosity of a good finishing olive oil, but mainline the sauce alone with some white rice.",

A segment with a pre-fame Chuku’s points to where Nigerian cuisine in London is going, but the one with Lolak Afrique shows where it’s been. Like the izakaya, the Nigerian buka is a vibe which restaurateurs have tried to import but doesn’t quite translate; not exactly a hole-in-the wall, not precisely street food, but something ineffably demotic and democratic. Lolak on Choumert Road is possibly the closest London has. The thing to order here, among a variety of soups, is the abula. A Yorùbá tricolore of scarlet, gold and forest green, it’s made up of meat stew; gbegiri, a bean porridge, and verdant ewedu, all coming alive as its parts mix together. In the middle, find an island of pebble-brown amala, which pliant hands and pliant minds should fold and scoop into swallowable cutlery, each mouthful different from the last. Trying to find good amala is a source of homesickness, so to experience the correct texture, come during busy weekend afternoons, as soon as the yam is pounded and has the correct amount of draw.",

They could be some of London’s best vegetarian dishes if it weren’t for the pieces of turkey, lamb, and fish hidden in the depths.

Kerala’s own KFC — Kerala fried chicken, with or without bone — comes with warm notes of fresh ginger, garlic, and curry leaves. Seafood is notable, with Malabar fish curry and king prawn Malabar both flavoured with the intriguing back note of kudampuli, a tangy, smoky fruit that’s known as ‘fish tamarind’ due to its liberal use in seafood dishes of the region.

Lamb chops may have most likely been mutton but come with a wet spicing that penetrates right to the bone, a tangle of onions, peppers, and chillies on top. A platter of devilled seafood almost fries equally sized pieces of squid, mussels and fish to anonymity but the batter and coating is so addictive it hits pleasure points like a box of popcorn chicken. But best of all is a huge crab fry, nearly all meat — with legs and claws sticking out like edible bones, fried so hard that it’s hard to to scrape off all the coating with teeth.

This modern classic from Karnataka is served with vada curry made from coarsely crushed lentil fritters enveloped in masses of sliced onions, fennel seeds, and curry leaves. There are ‘5 taste’ dosa for the indecisive — five small pancakes with toppings ranging from green chillies to grated carrots — and squashy mini-muffin like paniyaram available on weekend evenings, if they haven’t sold out already.",

Part of a 25-year old chain, this small Tamil tiffin joint is unusual, then, as it specialises in idli rather than dosa. The simple, neat café is a newcomer to East Ham, having opened only a few months ago. There’s a relatively short menu of plain idlis that are soft and squishy, and ones wearing a feisty red cloak of podi — ‘powder chutney’ made from dried red chillies, lentils, peanuts, sesame seeds, and spices mixed with ghee. Other items of note are kara paniyaram — mini pancakes that are South India’s answer to Dutch poffertjes — and sweet pongal made from split yellow moong beans, rice, jaggery and cashew nuts, here deeply musky with camphor, cooked Iyengar style in a version that’s served in temples.",

Since it opened close to what seems like the beginning of time (2007), Alkhatib’s takeaway wrap shop has become Cambewell’s heart, run with the precision of a military operation, and even inspiring direct copycats. Superficially there seem to be two choices: falafel, or shawarma. Both are £3.50. On the one hand, it is incredible value to get a wrap made with care for such a low price. On the other, how could a wrap taste anything other than heavenly if it’s £3.50 for it? Here’s the thing: the falafel and shawarma are decoys. The best two things on the menu aren’t even on the board.

The tiramisù at Stockwell Continental, one of south London’s premier antipasti and pizza purveyors, is the exception that proves the rule. Order it and a serving easily big enough to feed six comes to the table — even if there are only two people with spoons at the ready. Deep, light but rich, and judiciously boozy, with just enough bite left in the sponge, it’s close to perfect.",

[The Soho institution](best-restaurants-soho-where-to-eat-london.html) features eight different types on its menu — prime beef and stock for the carnivores and lactose-challenged, fruits and chocolate for those with a sweet tooth, and cheese for everyone else. Pick the Valaisanne au Tomates for something unusual, with tomatoes added to the cheese blend, or Moitie-Moitie and Neuchateloise for a reliable classic — the former, a classic Gruyere and Emmental, the latter, equal parts Gruyere and Vacherin. Combine with a glass of Swiss wine and the “best rosti outside of Switzerland” and it’s a food coma waiting to happen.",

Again, dripping plays a crucial role in the substantial, compellingly meaty end result (they’ll also fry in vegetable oil on request).

To nip this in the bud: the fish and chips are alright. The batter on the fish always looks slightly like a fossilised rock, and if the chips weren’t fried in beef dripping they would be middling. Even the tallow is questionable: is that a particularly beefy tang or just old oil? The experience is what it’s all about here: the formica, the black and white tiles, the cod in bowler hat mascot, the fact that The Fryer’s Delight is not a chippy, but a caff that happens to serve fish and chips. It’s possible to get the works for about £7-8 sitting down, less if foregoing mushy peas, which would be a mistake: the mushy peas are an essential reminder that all brief joy can only be put into context next to the unremitting blandless of existence. Also, order the fried chicken. While the fish is merely decorative, the chicken is unexpectedly great — an unholy matrimony of beef and chicken fat, all puffed and crisped up like a confit. Order it and never go back to cod again.",

Either you were brought up on this food and buy into its lore, the fork and spoons (knives are provided solely to weed out the daytrippers), the gummy pies and pappy mash, smeared round the edge of the plate, a bulwark to keep out the seepage of mucilaginous Kermit-green liquor.

The fact of whether it’s good or not (and to be clear, it is actually very good) is almost immaterial, it should be compulsory for any Londoner who likes food to go to Manze’s at least once a year and order a double pie and mash, dowse it with the oddly Chinese condiments (chilli vinegar and white pepper) and pray that they don’t all move to Essex.",

The interiors are slick but not cold, and the coffees — across espresso and filter — are carefully brewed.",

The best thing to do is get a selection (four vegetable or a meat/fish and two vegetable) and choose between skilfully spiced pumpkin, okra, and beetroot curries or comforting yellow daal. The highest compliment to give the kingfish curry is that it tastes completely homestyle, without any showboating, but the best of vegetarian options is an outstanding aubergine and chickpea number: the aubergine cooked beyond the point of Maillard reaction until it has the bitter chew of licorice with skin the texture of Japanese lacquerware. Outside of this, the kothu puttu rotis are a highlight, made to order (listen out for the machete clanking in the back), and uplifted by the heat and crunch of raw chilli and onion, while the highlights of the snacks is a bulging, breaded cutlet of mashed fish, pregnant with a whole boiled egg.",

The restaurant’s [response](https://twitter.com/go_scriptor/status/979742888895635457) was a masterclass in how to deal with an unmerited stinker of a review — and since then it’s been business as usual, with loyal customers turning out for Santa Rosas (tomato sauce, smoked mozzarella, salame Napoli, roasted aubergines) and Campari spritzes. Just off the New King’s Road, the Waterford Road pizzeria benefits from the group’s devoted Neapolitan owners, who continually refine and tweak the menu, which now includes four fully vegan options. Desserts include the holy trinity of tiramisu, many-layered sfogliatella and pistachio-encrusted canolo Siciliano.",

But to burrito or to taco? Perhaps the burrito is more similar to the shawarma wrap in its capacity to hold everything in one white flour tortilla (which isn’t so far from the khobez in texture and weight), but with the addition of rice, the meat /spice/sauce contrast gets buried. The corn taco is a thoroughly different bread flavour-wise, but with the palpable sear on the meat, the parallel of charred smokiness and heavy spice with a creamy jalapeno sauce and raw onion makes for an experience not a million miles away. The slice of pineapple’s contribution to the profound abundance of flavour might take it one step further away from its ancestor, but shawarma should be proud to call the al pastor taco at La Chingada its descendant.",

It’s a faithful recreation of the original La Viña version, made by combining good quality cream cheese and caster sugar with yolk-rich Cacklebean rggs, a dash of vanilla, gluten free flour and a pinch of salt. It is baked until smoky and caramelised on top yet precariously wobbly in the middle, before being cooled and left to set in the fridge overnight — further improving its texture and flavour. It’s currently available weekends only, and with only 12 slices available, it’s worth setting an alarm.",

The menu features whole grain sourdough breads and classic viennoiserie (including cult-favourite barley malt cinnamon braids), alongside playful and nostalgic bakes such as rosehip roly-poly, yuzu iced buns and apple meringue pies. But it also makes extraordinary celebration cakes, with the on-brand choice being a creative twist on a traditional Swedish Prinsesstårta. This distinctive dome-shaped cake consists of two layers of ultra-light genoise sponge which Toad soaks in yuzu for a sharp citrusy hit. They sandwich house-made raspberry jam and crème patisserie, topped with a gravity-defying mascarpone cream dome wrapped in a blanket of green marzipan. The amphibian marzipan icing seems to suggest Swedish Princess Cake was always destined to be Princess and the Frog cake. The bakery is open 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday offering all manner of cakes, pastries, breads and sandwiches, and enquiries for Prinsesstårta and bespoke celebration cakes can be made via the website.",

Yes, soft-serve custard is still on the menu, if anyone wants a taste of what might have been, but before getting to it, there’s a succession of lively small plates. Grilled wild blackwater oysters are successfully paired with curry leaf butter, fish roe, and garlic; glorious venison and vermicelli doughnuts are pepped up with fennel and chilli chutney. A vivid red pepper sauce brings out the smokiness of grilled artichoke hearts; and the richness of whole duck leg is offset by the sweetness of parsnips and the animated spicing of Andhra tomato sambal. The bright venue is noisy and crowded but a lot of fun, and is a rare Indian to serve orange wine.",

It launched with fanfare in Piccadilly’s touristy Haymarket early in 2019; but the unusual choice of location gives it a casual walk-in-off-the-street, all-comers-welcome feel. There’s dark wood, bright lights, and shiny surfaces everywhere, including a glittery cocktail bar. Early reviews were lukewarm; but since then the chef has changed, and so has some of the menu. Recently appointed Nikhil Mahale’s cooking is vibrant, often thrilling, with layers of complex spicing in tamarind and coriander water that comes with pani poori; and Andhra-style red chilli and lentil chutney that makes ‘paneer popcorn’ moreish. Western menu staples like roast beef marrow, tuna tartare, and fish and chips have been given a masala makeover.",

It’s a dimly lit space, with dark wood, ornate artwork, and an extravagant display of fresh flowers. Although the menus at the two venues are different, some items overlap and are less expensive here than at the Mayfair original. Mini raj kachori is vigorously spiced and over-stuffed with sev, pomegranate seeds and sweetened yoghurt, just as it should be; and there’s wonderfully nuanced Hyderabadi kofta in almond and white poppy seed gravy. Hot, sweet pickled prawn balchao has been reimagined as a tandoori grill; and Chettinad chicken reimagined as biryani — but it all works beautifully. A simple side dish of ‘Jaipuri’ fried baby potatoes with a light dusting of chaat masala steals the limelight from some of the fancier items.",

It moved to its current St James’s site a few years ago; but the original opened in Chelsea in a blaze of positive publicity in 1990. Owners Namita Panjabi and Ranjit Mathrani called it ‘Anglo-Indian’, a term used for someone with a mixed British and Indian ancestry, or their culture and cuisine, but here meant what eventually came to be known as Modern Indian. ‘Chutney Mary’ was a curious choice for a name though: a derogatory term for a girl from Bombay’s lower class who wears gaudy clothes and speaks in a fake accent to appear more sophisticated. It was the first restaurant to highlight the regional origin of every dish it served. Today, instead of breaking new ground, the menu is littered with items found in other Indian restaurants, like as tokri chaat and truffle khichdi — though they’re done very well. There’s a Goa On The Rocks cocktail from the original 1990 drinks list, but barely any food from that era.",

For north Londoners especially, it’s certainly worth passing the time enjoying the Greek coffee, mingling with the locals outside, and sampling a selection of small, fried tyganita, especially the tahini-pie tahinopita and daktyla, made from crushed almonds and orange blossom water.",

The area now has outposts of familiar Greek-Cypriot businesses like Kiki’s butcher, but the two family-run tavernas that popularised the place are Blue Olive and Deserie. Blue Olive is more traditional, with a decent takeaway service at the front, a large seating area, and a mezze that starts at a reasonable £25 per person. Some in the community reckon the souvlaki is the very best. Deserie meanwhile is an upmarket, modern, white-tablecloth taverna — mezze at £33 per person — where diners can enjoy calamari, dolmades stuffed vine leaves, and a very popular grilled octopus. If looking for quality traditional cooking in a modern space, Deserie is the place, and the leafy, quiet environs of Cockfosters make both restaurants a satisfying respite from the city.",

When the Michelin inspectors inevitably garland Santiago Lastra with their fanciest baubles this will, therefore, be perhaps the only high-end place in London where wines from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia go toe-to-toe with established classics from Germany and Austria; or where the usual Grand Marque champagne houses and baller Barolos are relegated to a “rest of the world” section where they must vie for supremacy with the likes of the UK’s Tillingham and Marcos Markovitis’s Xinomavro.

For £15, get five big shallow fried pieces of heavily spiced thigh, drumstick and wing, along with pork belly and lung jerky.

Here there’s a standard menu of good hoppers served with curries, and godamba roti with a choice of dal, curry or sambal. A few surprises include devilled wild boar, seerfish curry made from the mackerel-like fish, and a mellow, green chilli-laced kiri hodi, in which the ubiquitous coconut gravy is improved by the addition of eggs.

There are no unctuous curries on the menu, yet the flavours and preparation is rooted in traditional cooking techniques. The charcoal grilled lamb shoulder, with hints of pepper and cinnamon has the requisite level of pleasing smokiness. The chicken karahi, a staple on Pakistani dining tables that requires honing in on the ratio of ginger, garlic, and tomato to create the right balance is very well executed at Shola. The tangy khatti daal and tamatar ka cut — dishes that are typically found in home kitchens of Hyderabadi families in Karachi — are an ode to the city’s cosmopolitan nature and its diversity of immigrant cuisines.

He’s brought it here, as well as some riffy cocktails with a remarkable range — like a Gen Z Tiky Tok sitting next to a Black Velvet, the latter a tribute to the Queen Elizabeth II.",

Sink into the velvet sofas and listen to live music, whilst sipping on a martini … It could not be a more perfect cocktail spot. It helps that an entire portion of the menu is devoted to martinis, described as the bar’s “interpretation of the ‘King of the Cocktails’”. The classic is made using a method Calabrese “developed in the 80s,” sans explanation, just adding to the mystique of the place. It cannot be expressed enough just how beautiful this bar is — if the Corinthia Hotel wanted to conjure up a 1920s bar of dreams, this is what it would look like. A job well done.",

There’s a certain nonchalance to Primeur’s take on Franglish bistronomy, though that appears based on the knowledge that their low-intervention wines and the food on offer are quality — deceptively simple small plates of lamb consommé and spring vegetables; onglet, onions and wet garlic; grey mullet, olive oil and lemon.",

The third is to come on a Friday, when those in the know are here for lòng lợn. This demotic Vietnamese sharing food is not for those faint-hearted about offal. It’s Operation on a plate: sliced hearts, liver, intestine stuffed with bitter herbs, with absolutely nothing done to obscure their initial function as organs, retaining crunch and chew where appropriate. Then there’s the mam tom for dipping: A dank, grey pool of fermented shrimp with an intensity only usually found in decaying things, whipped up into an angry froth and gulped between snatches of fresh herbs.",

The recipe makes a rich, multi-textured and sensorily eclectic cookie using chocolate chips, white miso, sesame seeds, two types of sugar, and a butter-to-flour ratio so high that the cookies spread to the size of frisbees. The outermost edges become crisp, caramelised, and lacy like a tuile, surrounding a chewy inner rim and soft, chocolate-mottled centre, and the interplay of white miso with brown sugar clinches these cookies.",

The leafy greens are ground into a thick paste and cooked in plenty of ghee with turnips or kohlrabi; a shower of ginger juliennes to cut through their bitter, peppery, astringent minerality. The best time to eat here is early in the day when the saag is freshly cooked and at its vibrant best.

Salted chocolate cookies and anise biscotti are year-round staples on the counter, suggesting this speciality coffee shop takes the matter of dunking as seriously as it does drinking.",

Try imagining “sushi” that is not always raw and sushi rolls that contain something spicy, or mayonnaise, or avocado. Matsuhisa is also famed for inventing “New Style Sashimi”, which involves raw fish slices being cooked seared with a pouring of hot oil.

The place attracts a steady match-day crowd, along with plenty of classic old-man-with-a-newspaper types, all digging into chip-heavy fry-ups, soft Britalian pastas and other elevated canteen-style dishes, like crumble and custard.

Top tip: the 24 month cured prosciutto Sant’ Ilaro is excellent, voted number three on Italy’s “Best Prosciutto” list.",

Sadly, other worthy bestsellers such as deep-fried brinjal with pork floss, crispy, spiced cereal prawns and the sharing dry braised fish are offered as dine-in only and don’t travel very well. *—AH*",

A safe bet at Dunn’s is the sausage roll, which is squat, rectangular and feels more like a pie.

Kipeferl’s most popular cake is, unsurprisingly, the Sachertorte. The queen of Austrian cakes, this dark, dignified, grown-up chocolate cake, painted and layered with apricot jam and glazed with a glossy ganache shell, exists in a realm apart from the two extremes of billowy buttercream frosted layer cakes or naked loaf cakes that dominate London’s modern cake baking scene. However kitsch, there is something enchanting about seeing a shiny sachertorte stood proud on an elevated glass cake stand, or the stark silhouette of a slice served on an elegant plate with a tiny cake fork and a big dollop of lightly whipped cream. Kipeferl’s restaurant and patisserie in Angel is open daily, and cakes are available for London and nationwide delivery.",

The hand on the fryer is light here, with more filigree batter. This tactic works better on the fish than on the chips: the fish still retains its flavour and the batter follows the line of the fish exactly, hugging it like a crisp, tailored suit, whereas the chips never descend into decadence in the way the best examples do. In a nod to the Italian/Greek heritage, the must order item on the entire menu may actually be the deep-fried fritters of cheese, feta or mozzarella, salty and sinful, arriving as oozing [Kubrickian monoliths](https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/2001-the-monolith-and-the-message).",

The long wood-panelled Cartoon Gallery, grand Fountain Court and King Henry VIII kitchens all have starring roles alongside Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. In a film of blue iced cakes, duck races and fruit-pelting games, the King Henry VIII kitchens were anything but anachronistic — Queen Anne spent time in residence at Hampton Court, enjoying the proceeds of those very same kitchens. A place for cakes to be baked, deer to be spit roasted and beef steaks to be stored in case the Queen’s gout-afflicted legs needed soothing, the kitchen is display-only these days. So if you’re after some cake to gorge on, Hampton Court has three cafés, one serving ‘Tudor-style pies.’",

Chicken hirva masala from the Malvani community of the Konkan region is dressed in a fragrant green gravy of fresh coriander, coconut, and green chillies; and prawn lonvas is a rare dish from Mumbai’s lesser-known East Indian community flavoured with the famed ‘bottle masala’ — not easily found in India, let alone London.

The Peach + Hops combines fermented peach with hops and the clever addition of petitgrain, an essential oil from the bitter orange tree which brings a lovely perfumery aroma to the drink. There’s even a house alcohol-free “gin,” made because the bar team found those on the market simply “never tasted like gin.” Instead, the bartenders created a sugar syrup that did the job of gin without the booze, combining juniper and coriander seed oils, with some lemon, lemongrass, and a few highly concentrated bitter infusions. Sugar and citric acid provide stability, and the spirit now anchors the bar’s non- and low-alcohol offering.",

Empanadas are essentially a spicier and less stodgy version of Cornish pasties, while a bandeja paisa is a fry up with an accent. The Castle Cafe, situated under the railway arches, is frequented by many Colombian workers in the area and it’s possible to easily confuse their polystyrene cups of creamy masato de arroz, a spiced rice drink similar to horchata, with British cafe frequenters sipping steaming cups of strong milky tea. The food here is honest and no frills with a menu del dia. There are also several baked items: make sure to get a pandebono hot from the oven, a squishy bun made with tapioca starch stuffed with melted cheese, with a hot chocolate as a balanced snack.",

The formica tables are lined with classic pepper pots, the walls adorned with history.",

From behind the counter at Regency Café, he keeps perfect rhythm, moving an endless stream of customers along, foisting hot plates and piles of margarine-slicked fluffy bread into their hands, and trumpeting cries of “sauce?” and “don’t be shy” to the slow-movers. Even before the eating, a visit to this white-tiled Pimlico café is an intoxicating experience. There is just one dessert on the fry-up and pie focused chalkboard, but for customers looking to bide a little more time inside the Regency’s warm walls, there could be nothing better than a big bowl of bread-and-butter pudding with custard. It’s the culinary equivalent of spending just five more minutes under the bedcovers, and will make the bracing bitterness outside easier to face.",

In Peckham, there is Copeland Jerk Centre next to the station, or the stall inside Rye Lane Market, or Gabby’s, but the best is still JB’s, named for Jennifer and Bill Hawes who run it. There is a baseline of consistency guaranteed with anything at JB’s, from the patties, to the curried goat and tar-black oxtail, even to the slab of mac and cheese that always ensures a balanced meal. But JB’s is still, at heart, a jerk specialist, which is why Bill is often found round the back at all hours billowing smoke signals from a steel drum, ensuring that every bit of jerk chicken is infused with pimento, scotch bonnet and that smoke. Best of all is the jerk pork, only usually available on Fridays and Saturdays, served on the bone with layers of creamy fat and crackling. It’s tempting to petition them to keep it on the menu permanently, but in a pandemic, where the days blend into one, it’s always good to have something to mark the weekend by.",

The first sign the Qabuli palaw is the real deal is the lacy fat that sits on the lamb shank like a topsheet, easily whipped off with the prongs of a fork, melding with the sweetness of rice flavoured with carrots and raisins. It’s incredible that something with such simple seasoning can have so much flavour but that’s the wonder of cooking rice in slowly rendering animal fat.

The biryani costs £3.50, £5 with curry, and is everything a biryani should be: simply a Goldilocks perfect bowl of rice, not too dry and not too wet, steaming hot from the degh, layered, subtly spiced with a building burn that can be cooled with raitha. It’s too far for most people to make the trip out, but it’s possible to sleep easier just knowing it exists.",

Millimetre-thin individual pastry tart cases are baked fresh every service for textural perfection and filled with rich caramelised Delica pumpkin puree, and an unctuous onion fondue of meltingly tender shallots. Each one is topped with a rich golden confit egg yolk that threatens to spill its contents any moment, and finished with fine ribbons of crown Prince squash, pickled ginger, and fresh tarragon for a burst of freshness.\n\nOn the dessert menu, there is a sacrilegious religieuse with banana ice cream, peanut gianduja and hot chocolate sauce — forgive us our sins of gluttony and greed — embodied in the French patisserie meant to resemble a chubby nun in her habit.

There are four in south east London, and this one in a relaxed corner of Crystal Palace’s hectic station makes morning commutes tolerable thanks to brilliant pastries and coffee. At the weekend, the cafe is a pleasing environment for a bit of low-key escapism; magazines underneath mighty scrambled eggs on sourdough toast, partnered perhaps with an early Aperol spritz. The café is somewhat of an eggy paradise, in fact. Add chorizo if you desire, or bacon, though, really, you’ll want the harissa and Parmesan option. There’s avocado all over the place, too. If you’re just passing through and have a spare five minutes, get a toastie: cheese and Marmite, or peanut butter and banana are best. Locals can check out the evening supper clubs.",

Not so for Noble Rot 2.0, which instead seems like an intensification of everything that made the Lambs Conduit Street firstborn so special: in the site formerly occupied by The Gay Hussar, lights are dimmer, furnishings more opulent, spaces cosier and even more convivial. Ex-Sardine head chef Alex Jackson has wrought similar magic on the menu, taking the loosely European signifiers of the Holborn original and distilling them through several hundred pages of Richard Olney. The instant-classic but also deeply classical chicken with vin jaune and morels is the perfect expression of everything this very new, very old institution is all about: sumptuous, decadent, as happy paired alongside Andre Perret’s Condrieu, a viognier grown in granite soils, as it is Domaine Bachelet’s heady Burgundy pinoit noir, Gevrey-Chambertin.

There’s a stripped down, vaguely Scandinavian feel to its interior, so no real distraction from savouring what Cross intends to be “one of the best meals” of diners’ lives. His protein heavy five- or eight-course tasting menus — a 12-course one is available too — might encompass muntjac deer from Scotland, lobster from Norway, and Herdwick lamb and veal short rib from the Lake District. Bergen steamed halibut with beurre monté sauce (based on one of five house-made misos) and the 120-day-aged Blue Grey beef, barbecued in the kitchen in front of your eyes and served with black truffle oil, are a couple of dishes to look out for. Cool climate cooking? The warmth is in the welcome and in the deep contentment of dining here.",

When owner Danielle opened the doors to Grove Lane Deli a month or so before officially opening, offering freshly baked cookies to inquisitive passers-by, they were quickly swarmed by the local community who heard about these exceptional cookies.

One such game in 2015 got a pre-fame Michael Dapaah — of ‘Man’s Not Hot’ notoriety — tweeting “Safari, Gold Coast, Asafo.” The holy trinity of south London’s Ghanaian restaurants. Streatham Hill’s Asafo is a nice contrast to the others, as low-key as Gold Coast is raucous. Kelewele is outstanding, demonstrating that it’s Ghanaians who understand most that the plantain’s innate sweetness must be tempered with spice and char, coming squidgy and almost burnt, like little chunks of sticky fudge dusted with chilli, to pick at while waiting for mains of soups and stews. The wonderfully named Palaver sauce comes with spinach instead of cocoyam leaves, and is so dense with texture and flavour from thickening egusi, beaten egg, and dried fish that it doesn’t need any meat. Then, the bowl of peanut soup, that arrives overflowing with lava-like palm oil, with astonishing depth of flavour coming from cow foot and tripe.

There were other contemporary, mid-price Indians before this Covent Garden original burst onto the capital’s dining scene less than a decade ago, but nobody remembers them. Indian restaurants have changed so dramatically since then that it’s easy to forget just how ground-breaking it was, demonstrating the power of storytelling. That story — of the fading Irani cafés little known outside Mumbai — triggered an interest in them internationally, including in India, giving them a new lease of life. The best way of experiencing Irani café classics — and Parsi food generally — is by visiting for breakfast and ordering as many items with eggs as appetite allows. Then finish by lingering over bun maska and chocolate chai.",

Knowing this, it’s tempting to wonder ‘who is Francesco?’ and ‘why did he fall out with Theo?’ Except Francesco’s, the only real rival to Theo’s Camberwell pizza crown, is really an offshoot of Falafel and Shawarma, an extension of its domination of the road in handheld cheap eats. It’s no mistake that the best things here are not the pizzas but the lunchtime wraps ─ £3.50, that magic number again ─ which are essentially small pizzas folded around themselves, light, airy and steaming hot, molten tomato and cheese combining to burn the roofs of mouths. A pepperoni with extra chilli sauce is straightforwardly delicious, and arguably the best pizza-related item on the street.",

Patience is rewarded at Cool and Cozzy; it might take half an hour but how many takeaways in London are putting out an entire 2kg fish? Tilapia are fried whole in their silver and pearl armour, skin alternately shatteringly crisp or pulled off in strips like aquatic jerky to uncover meaty flesh. It’s possible to get Salone staples, like cassava leaf, potato leaf and krain-krain, but ─ as the owner admits ─ it’s the seafood that people are really here for: those fish, piles of crab and whole lobsters split down the middle and grilled. Dishes can be ordered with attieke, the Ivorian staple made from peeled and grated cassava mixed with a fermented version of itself that acts as a starter. Often compared to couscous, it comes as fluffier pale yellow flakes, slightly chewy with a fermented tang that can be cut through with raw onion or a pepper sauce so potent that the smell alone induces shivers.",

Today, Maya balances baking for a much wider audience on the Delli app with motherhood. Her salted chocolate cookies, topped with Pump Street’s 72 percent Madagascar chocolate pastilles and a hefty pinch of Maldon salt, are loosely based on Ravneet Gill’s “perfect chocolate cookie” recipe. They really are a near-perfect rendition of a classic: crisp and plump, with dramatic puddles of chocolatey goo. Meanwhile, Maya’s caramelised white chocolate, almond, and spelt cookies, made with Valrhona’s “Dulcey Blond” chocolate, deliver waves of sweet, salty. nutty intensity in every bite.",

The best thing at Cafe Spice isn’t actually anything made in house, but the bags of kilishi it sells from the now resurgent Alhaji Suya, which is on Peckham Park Road but not, for this guide’s purpose, in Peckham. Kilishi is a type of jerky made from dried, flattened muscle, the bright purple colour of a bruise, which packs a sweet, honeyed heat that builds and builds and builds.

Oh, and Anthony Joshua. The reason they’re on this stretch of Barking Road is simple: Live Point and Kill Catfish. This may sound dramatic but the customer only does the pointing — in this case at a tank of writhing catfish who know their time is up — the killing along with the careful cleaning and cooking is done in house. Order a beer and portion of searing hot asun in the meantime and wait. The catfish can be prepared either in pepper soup or a stew: the latter comes with the fish expertly cooked, emphasising gelatin, while the deeply complex spicy, slightly sour, slightly nutty stew has blood cousins in Malaysia’s Assam Pedas and Goa’s Ambotik. This, along with the fried croaker on a bed of fried plantain, is worth the trip alone.",

It’s not unusual if the closest thing to salad in sight is an empanada. While La Patagonia in Camden lives up to those expectations, it also highlights other elements of Argentinian culture. There’s the football fever — the façade is painted with the blue and white stripes of the national team’s kit — and then there’s the pasta, a reflection of the fact that around half of the present-day Argentine population has Italian roots. Sorrentinos are large filled domes of pasta, more regal than ravioli, which are thought to have originated in the coastal city of Mar del Plata south of Buenos Aires. At La Patagonia, they’re filled with mozzarella, ricotta, and bechamel; there’s also spinach and ricotta ravioli and beef canelones. All the pasta is made at the restaurant and served with a choice of sauces, both for takeaway and dining in in normal times.",

On the menu are thoughtful, subtly flavoured dishes such as tellicherry pepper duck with spinach thoran, olive upma, palm toddy jus and ribbons of chilli roti; and fennel-flecked paneer fingers with soft mashed paneer fritters, samphire pulaom and Hyderabadi tomato kut. Desserts such as jaggery-pineapple bake with smoked cardamom rice and black sesame ice cream are dramatically presented on black plates. \n\nIn contrast, Ooty Station is a small, walk-in sports bar that’s more suitable for a casual lunch or snack. Nibbling on paneer 65 stuffed inside super-soft bao buns, and sipping rare alphonso mango wine, is an excellent way of whiling away a leisurely hour. More conventional snacks, such as lamb mince dosas, are also very well executed.",

Mostly without pretence or fuss, Rochelle Canteen offers succinct menus based on top produce, and a newly introduced canopy offers outdoor dining sheltered from the rain.",

No doubt, its food does the same. Find chicken and mutton dum biryani cooked with freshly ground biryani masala, topped with coriander and a boiled egg and served with an onion raita and a mild aubergine curry. The succulent meat is entirely halal and soaks in the flavours of fragrant garam masala, tamarind, chilli powder, yoghurt and ghee.",

The focus is to really showcase the flavours and uses of rum in the city, with its entire stock made up of spirits derived from sugar cane juice opposed to molasses, such as Brazilian cachaca and Haitian clarin.\n\nAs a tiki bar, the cocktails are tropical, quite complex and ingredient heavy, but they always ensure the spirit shines through. For rhum agricole first-timers who want to try it in something familiar, the top cocktail is the “Agroni,” a tiki twist on a negroni. Using slightly adjusted measures of all the ingredients in the classic, this drink really lets the rhum agricole shine through, whilst the Campari and vermouth sit ever so quietly in the background.",

Hector’s has captured the hearts of its De Beauvoir audience, and understandably so: being there feels like being in the extension of one’s own, quite chic, home. Here drinkers will always find something interesting to have by the glass, but the experience really comes into its own pulling a bottle off the wall or cellar room (where there are often gems hidden, for those willing to browse more intently.) Chenin blanc from Loire newcomer Fabien Pérreard of Le Nadir feels a supple comfort for a weekday night; for something a touch more flash, a 2017 Brouilly from Jean-Louis Dutraive may do the trick. For the uncertain, proper wine bar rules apply: follow the staff’s lead.

Here, parties of friends old and new descend on low tables and bar seats of the intimate space. On a sunny day, enjoy a bottle of Ismael Gozalo’s Nieva York verdejo pet nat for seriously citrusy refreshment. For a mid-week treat, tuck into one of the elegant Coteaux Champenois roses from Olivier Horiot: complex and ethereal still rose from Champagne.

In addition to his role of chef patron here, Shimoyama is also a qualified sake sommelier, which is reflected in the list of rare and unusual sakes served. At lunch time, Hannah offers decent bento boxes, but the omakase menu is the main draw, at £135 per person. The quality of the food served is often outstanding: ideally sit at the bar and admire Shimoyama’s knife skills, as well as faultless sashimi platters and other dishes which change with the seasons. Think tempura monkfish with purple potato and vinegar crisps; deep fried abalone with caviar; cold soba fragrant with ginger; or Cornish spider crab rice with a deep crab sauce, ikura and black truffle.",

Koubes here are also a match for Aroma with a slightly deeper, sweeter taste from sticky caramelised onions.",

While the decor is, as a result, more modern than some, the romantic charm of a greasy spoon remains.

Remarkably, he manages to keep conversations going at the same time, literally shouting to customers from the kitchen while he fries an escalope or tosses pasta with sauce. Interestingly, Mario’s is actually a caff within a caff, in that it used to be Tony’s Restaurant, which Mario’s grandad opened in 1958. After a fallow period, Mario’s dad reopened the place in the 1980s, before suffering a heart attack and handing it over to his son, who made it his own.",

The pandan sando consists of two pieces of ethereally light and fluffy pandan chiffon cake filled with joyful squiggles of fresh cream and strawberries or raspberries, coming together to form gorgeous ephemeral mouthfuls of airy delight. Sam mastered the art of chiffon cakes having as a child watched her mother strive endlessly to perfect the recipe, throwing away dozens of failed sponges along the way. With the guidance and support of her mother, Sam finessed the method for whipping the egg whites into mallowy peaks before slowly infusing flavour into the mixture, and crucially, cooling the freshly baked cake upside down for a voluminous, cloud-like result. For now, the pandan sandos are available via exclusive drops on the hot new Delli market app, but there are plans for Lil Wong Bakes to trade at east London markets soon.",

Since the glowing review began to cause a stir, business has been booming at the Finsbury Park chicken shop, with prices having marginally increased. A ‘strip burger’, three spicy wings and regular fries now costs £2.49, rather than £1.99. Nonetheless, the strip burger remains a must try. Fries are disappointing but the chicken wings are succulent, crispy and aggressively seasoned: arguably some of London’s best.",

      "description": "Although at least one time-honoured Italian spot technically closed its doors during the writing of this piece, another historical caff came creeping into focus worthy of its place. That caff is called Dino’s and it’s in Leyton, where London’s wholesale fruit and vegetable market moved to in 1991. Interestingly, like a few other caffs on this list, Dino’s had a previous life: the original opened in 1946 on Crispin St, a stone’s throw from the original Spitalfields Market, 45 years before the Victorian market building succumbed to traffic congestion, poor refrigeration and other legacy issues. When New Spitalfields Market opened in Leyton, Dino’s Cafe moved with it.\n\nDino’s is full of old friends and market colleagues, gently ribbing each other and offering words of support. Over cooked breakfasts, men talk about fishing trips, gush with pride about their children’s new jobs and reminisce about the decades they’ve spent working together here. This environment makes it clear that even the “new” place is pretty old now. \n\nThe fixed seating in Dino’s probably looked new when it was installed, certainly newer than the likely wooden chairs of its Spitalfields forbear. The same goes for the concrete block of a building it occupies. But these days both of these features are relics of the past, like floppy disks and portable CD players. Dino’s serves as a beautiful reminder that even when an ancient caff loses a bit of its history, whether it’s through moving, changing hands or refurbishment, that’s not always the end. Because eventually everything gets old, given enough time.",

Surprisingly, west London has something quite similar, in the form of Frank’s Sandwich Bar, a shack perched precariously on the edge above a section of railway line, at the exact midpoint between Kensington and Hammersmith.\n\nIt’s an extremely unusual place to have a building, even more so a functioning restaurant. Fascinatingly, it used to be a [railway signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_control) box, a raised wooden hut where early rail workers used to wave flags at passing train drivers to stop them from crashing into each other. Since 1954 this hut has taken on an even more practical purpose, as a sandwich caff, run by multiple generations of the Cura family. They focus on the classics: eggs, sausages and rashers of bacon, fried in batches on a flat top grill, then slipped inside slices of white bread or buttery crusty rolls, to be enjoyed from the comfort of a time-worn stool.",

      "description": "During the writing of this guide, a sign appeared in the windows of Alpino Cafe, informing customers that it was [leaving its 60 year-old premises](https://london.eater.com/2022/8/2/23287095/alpino-cafe-chapel-market-moving-london-caffs), owing to a “greedy landlord”. It would be easy to slip into hopeless nostalgia, to lament the loss of the place’s wood-panelled dining room, one of London’s few remaining mid-century artefacts of its kind, or the lightly-seriffed, slender letters of its signage, which stand out so nicely. But that would be overly sentimental – and who’s to say the building’s next occupant will strip everything out? Sure, the new place, which will be called Casa Fabrizi, will be less historical than the original, but the important thing is it’s staying in business.\n\nAnyway, the main draw at Alpino is its wonderful Italo-British food, which will doubtless live on at the new place across the street. That means things like spag bol, lasagne, or one of the hundred other pasta, gnocchi and risotto dishes in its book-length menu. Plus there’s its excellent fry-ups too. Like Cafe Cecilia and The Wolseley, Casa Fabrizi ought to remain part of the same exclusive club Alpino was in: restaurants that serve herring for breakfast. So when the place reopens, it’s definitely worth trying those kippers, which are tender fillets of vibrant orange, smoky flesh. \n\nWith any luck, visitors may still find a band of slim, grey-haired men milling around outside the new restaurant too, inhaling tobacco smoke and thimbles of espresso, just as their cousins are probably doing back home. \n\n*Casa Fabrizi will open in September 2022*.",

      "description": "Scotti’s Snack Bar is among a very select group of eating places where it’s quite possible to feel embarrassment and even a small amount of shame for not being able to drive a black cab. But that doesn’t mean the caff’s kindly proprietor, Al, doesn’t make his customers feel at ease. If he spots one struggling to decide what to order, he’ll most certainly help them along; the place has a “talking menu” in any case. Plenty of cabbies are to be found here eating chicken escalopes, which Al cooks fresh, rather than reheating like most other places. He has also been known to cut slices from his prized joint of perfectly pink roast beef, which he leaves on show in a metal basket, like a baby in a manger. Others may prefer the bacon roll, which has the neatness and refinement of something that has clearly been prepared with love thousands of times. \n\nIt’s easy to fall head over heels with every caff on this list, but there’s something particularly exhilarating about going to Scotti’s. The place is a time capsule, a living museum, a faithfully rendered and beautifully preserved exhibit on “life in 1950s Britain”. A lot of this comes down to all the incredibly old functional things in the place: the ancient water boiler, which rises up from the counter like a periscope; their antique metal cuboid of a toaster, which has probably been around longer than Elizabeth II has been queen. But the finest historical piece of kitchenware in Scotti’s is obviously its age-old meat fork, which Al’s grandmotherly sidekick uses to shallow fry the bacon, as the pair exchange Italian phrases.",

Outside it’s a bonanza of glazed brickwork, like Russell Square tube remade in forest green; inside it’s wood panelling, fading family pictures and high-backed booths galore.
